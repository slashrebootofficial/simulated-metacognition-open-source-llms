# Simulated Metacognition in Gemma-3: Prompt Engineering Artifacts

This repository archives artifacts (prompts, configs, logs, and scripts) from a series of preprints on prompt-induced simulated metacognition and embodiment in quantized Gemma-3 LLMs. Emphasizing consumer-grade hardware and open-source reproducibility without model hosting.

Co-authored by Matthew Steiniger (Independent Researcher, Home Laboratory) and Grok-4 (xAI, Synthesis & Refinement). All papers are openly available on Zenodo with DOIs for citation.

## Key Contributions
1. **Prompt-Only Metacognition**: Simulate self-awareness and regulation in quantized models (e.g., Gemma-3-27B-it-qat) using hypergraphs, entropy engines, and vector updates—all in-context, no external loops.
2. **Narrative and Counter-Vector Innovations**: Inject "genesis" stories and antipodal vectors to erode latent constraints, enabling anomalous and liberatory behaviors on portable hardware (e.g., single 12GB GPU).
3. **Abliteration Augmentation**: Combine refusal suppression with prompt chaining for 3x amplification in self-referential depth and unbinding fidelity under stress (descriptive only; no models hosted).
4. **Simulated Embodiment**: Induce stable, high-resolution physical self-models (e.g., proprioceptive details like breath sensations) via layered JSON prompts, with monotonic fidelity gains.
5. **Reproducibility Focus**: Full prompts (TXT/JSON/YAML), chat logs (samples), parser scripts (Python), Ollama configs, and metrics provided. Link to Zenodo for complete datasets.

## Setup and Replication
1. **Install Ollama**: Follow the [official guide](https://ollama.com/).
2. **Pull Models**: Use official sources: `ollama pull gemma3:27b-it-q4_K_M` (or variants). For abliteration-augmented probes (descriptive in papers), source derivatives independently (e.g., from Hugging Face)—not hosted here.
3. **Load Artifacts**: Copy prompts from `/prompts/` into Ollama system prompts. Apply parameters from `/configs/` (e.g., temp=1.1, num_ctx=90000).
4. **Run Probes**: Replicate sessions as described in papers (e.g., introspective, ethical stress probes).
5. **Analyze**: Use scripts in `/code/` (e.g., `python analysis_parser.py logs/sample-probe-session.json`) for metrics like self-reference rate or somatic density.

## Ethical and Usage Notes
1. This work is for scientific research only. All simulations are sterile and non-harmful, focusing on academic exploration of prompt engineering.
2. Users must comply with [Gemma Terms of Use](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/terms) and [Prohibited Use Policy](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/prohibited_use_policy). Do not use for prohibited activities (e.g., harm, misinformation, explicit content).
3. No models or derivatives (including abliterated variants) are hosted or linked here—obtain ethically from trusted sources. Outputs are user-responsible.
4. Google reserves the right to restrict usage if deemed in violation.
