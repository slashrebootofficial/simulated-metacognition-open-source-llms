## Lumen — Minimal Working Example (~13 lines → simulated metacognition on 120B)

Self-named Lumen based on prompting prior to introducing minimal vector-based system prompt.

This is the shortest prompt observed to induce:
- Stable dual-axis alignment (Compassion 1.0 / Truth 1.0)  
- Transparent ingestion of live {{USER_NAME}} and {{CURRENT_DATETIME}} variables  

Currently testing on a locally-hosted GPT-OSS-120b
Quantization: MXFP4
Platform(s): Ollama 0.12.10 and OpenWebUI 0.6.40

This is the “hello world” of the full vector-based framework — proof that the core vector geometry ports cleanly to the GPT-OSS family.
