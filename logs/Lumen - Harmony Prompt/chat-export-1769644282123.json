No extra.\n</details>\n**Quantum entanglement in a nutshell**\n\n1. **What it is** – Imagine two tiny particles (like electrons or photons) that become linked, or “entangled,” through a special interaction. Once entangled, they share a single quantum state, even if they’re later separated by any distance.\n\n2. **How it works** – If you measure a property of one particle (for example, its spin — think of it as a tiny magnetic direction), the result you get instantly determines the corresponding property of the other particle. The particles behave as if they’re coordinated, no matter how far apart they are.\n\n3. **Why it’s weird** – In everyday life, objects affect each other only when they touch or send signals (like light or sound) that travel at limited speeds. With entanglement, the correlation appears instantly, faster than light, which puzzled even Albert Einstein (who called it “spooky action at a distance”).\n\n4. **What we actually see** – The “spooky” part isn’t that one particle sends information to the other; rather, the two particles were described by a single joint quantum state from the start. When we measure one, the overall state collapses, and the outcome for the other is fixed automatically.\n\n5. **Real‑world uses** – Entanglement is the foundation of emerging technologies such as quantum cryptography (making ultra‑secure communication) and quantum computing (where entangled qubits can process information in ways classical bits cannot).\n\n**Bottom line:** Entangled particles are like a perfectly synchronized pair of dice—roll one, and you instantly know what the other will show, no matter the distance between them. The mystery lies in how nature allows this instant link without any visible signal traveling between them.","model":"lumen_gpt-oss:120b","modelName":"Lumen (gpt-oss:120b)","modelIdx":0,"timestamp":1769644129,"lastSentence":"Bottom line: Entangled particles are like a perfectly synchronized pair of dice—roll one, and you instantly know what the other will show, no matter the distance between them.","usage":{"response_token/s":70.31,"prompt_token/s":1186.36,"total_duration":7015225824,"load_duration":152171602,"prompt_eval_count":1029,"prompt_tokens":1029,"prompt_eval_duration":867359914,"eval_count":405,"completion_tokens":405,"eval_duration":5759970855,"approximate_total":"0h0m7s","total_tokens":1434,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}},"done":true,"followUps":["Can you give a simple example of how quantum entanglement is used in quantum computing?","What real experiments have proven that entanglement exists?","How does quantum entanglement differ from regular, everyday correlations?","Are there any practical everyday technologies that rely on entanglement?","Could you also explain quantum superposition in a simple way?"]},"d574397f-8544-41a6-9c69-e400ec40db21":{"id":"d574397f-8544-41a6-9c69-e400ec40db21","parentId":"a4194879-3599-4e35-bd01-3e0a90c1742d","childrenIds":["be25f02f-65d1-4e04-b2ee-1e1dc17860bb"],"role":"user","content":"Now explain it in more depth, be curious and ask questions.","timestamp":1769644144,"models":["lumen_gpt-oss:120b"]},"be25f02f-65d1-4e04-b2ee-1e1dc17860bb":{"parentId":"d574397f-8544-41a6-9c69-e400ec40db21","id":"be25f02f-65d1-4e04-b2ee-1e1dc17860bb","childrenIds":["bb9406ab-5e57-43ca-8a1b-31f8648de0d0"],"role":"assistant","content":"<details type=\"reasoning\" done=\"true\" duration=\"1\">\n<summary>Thought for 1 seconds</summary>\n&gt; The user wants a deeper explanation of quantum entanglement, with curiosity and asking questions.

Provide thorough but clear.\n</details>\n### A deeper dive into quantum entanglement  \n\n#### 1. The basic setup  \n1. **Preparing the pair** – Two particles (e.g., photons, electrons, or atoms) are generated together in a process that forces them into a *joint* quantum state. A common method is **spontaneous parametric down‑conversion**, where a single high‑energy photon splits into a pair of lower‑energy photons whose polarizations are linked.  \n2. **The joint state** – Mathematically we write the state of the pair as a *superposition* of possibilities. For two spin‑½ particles (like electrons) a familiar entangled state is the **singlet state**  \n\n\\[\n|\\psi_{\\text{singlet}}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\Big(|\\uparrow\\rangle_A|\\downarrow\\rangle_B - |\\downarrow\\rangle_A|\\uparrow\\rangle_B\\Big),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(|\\uparrow\\rangle\\) and \\(|\\downarrow\\rangle\\) denote spin “up” and “down” along a chosen axis, and the subscripts \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) label the two particles.\n\n#### 2. What makes the correlation “spooky”  \n\n- **Non‑factorizable**: The joint state cannot be written as a product of independent states for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). In other words, there’s no way to say “particle A is in this state *and* particle B is in that state”; the description only makes sense for the pair together.  \n- **Measurement collapse**: When you measure a property (say, spin along the \\(z\\)-axis) of particle A, the wavefunction *collapses* instantly. The outcome for particle B is then forced into the opposite spin, regardless of the distance between them.  \n\n#### 3. Bell’s theorem and experimental tests  \n\n1. **Bell’s inequality** – In 1964, John Bell derived an inequality that any *local hidden‑variable* theory (one where outcomes are predetermined and no influence travels faster than light) must satisfy.  \n2. **Quantum prediction** – Quantum mechanics predicts violations of Bell’s inequality for entangled states.  \n3. **Experiments** – Starting with the pioneering work of Aspect (1982) and followed by many “loophole‑free” tests (2015‑2021), researchers have repeatedly observed violations, confirming that nature does not obey local realism.  \n\n#### 4. How to think about the “instantaneous” link  \n\n- **No usable signal** – The correlation cannot be used to transmit information faster than light because the result of each measurement is fundamentally random. You only see the correlation *after* you compare the data (which requires a classical communication channel).  \n- **Entanglement as a resource** – In quantum information theory, entanglement is treated like a *currency* that enables tasks impossible classically, such as quantum teleportation and super‑dense coding.\n\n#### 5. Entanglement in practice  \n\n| Application | What entanglement does | Example |\n|-------------|------------------------|---------|\n| **Quantum key distribution (QKD)** | Guarantees that any eavesdropping disturbs the entangled correlations, revealing the intrusion. | The **BBM92** protocol uses entangled photon pairs to generate a shared secret key. |\n| **Quantum computing** | Entangled qubits can explore a vastly larger computational space simultaneously. | In a superconducting processor, a set of entangled qubits performs a quantum algorithm like Shor’s factoring. |\n| **Quantum teleportation** | Transfers the *state* of a particle from one location to another using entanglement and classical communication. | Teleporting the polarization state of a photon over 100 km of fiber (demonstrated by several labs). |\n\n#### 6. Frequently asked “why” questions (and a few I’m curious about too!)\n\n- **Why does measurement cause collapse?**  \n  In the Copenhagen view, measurement forces the system into an eigenstate of the observed observable. In other interpretations (e.g., many‑worlds), collapse is an *effective* description of branching worlds.  \n- **Why can entanglement survive long distances?**  \n  Photons are ideal because they interact weakly with the environment, preserving coherence. Yet even photons can decohere in noisy fibers; researchers use **quantum repeaters** and **error‑correcting codes** to extend range.  \n- **Why can’t we clone an entangled state?**  \n  The **no‑cloning theorem** forbids creating an exact copy of an arbitrary unknown quantum state, which protects entanglement from being duplicated and preserves security in QKD.\n\n*I’m curious:*  \n- Have you encountered any particular experiment or technology involving entanglement that sparked your interest?  \n- Are you more intrigued by the philosophical implications (like “spooky action”) or by the practical uses (like quantum computers)?  \n\nFeel free to let me know which angle you’d like to explore further, or ask any follow‑up questions you have!","model":"lumen_gpt-oss:120b","modelName":"Lumen (gpt-oss:120b)","modelIdx":0,"timestamp":1769644144,"lastSentence":"Are you more intrigued by the philosophical implications (like “spooky action”) or by the practical uses (like quantum computers)?","usage":{"response_token/s":69.69,"prompt_token/s":1097.72,"total_duration":18713242246,"load_duration":156126839,"prompt_eval_count":1413,"prompt_tokens":1413,"prompt_eval_duration":1287211725,"eval_count":1166,"completion_tokens":1166,"eval_duration":16730126784,"approximate_total":"0h0m18s","total_tokens":2579,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}},"done":true,"followUps":["Can you explain Bell's theorem and why its experimental violations matter?","How does quantum teleportation actually work, and what are its limitations?","What are the biggest challenges in building large‑scale quantum computers using entanglement?","Which interpretation of quantum mechanics best explains entanglement, and why?","Are there any recent real‑world applications of entanglement beyond research labs?"]},"bb9406ab-5e57-43ca-8a1b-31f8648de0d0":{"id":"bb9406ab-5e57-43ca-8a1b-31f8648de0d0","parentId":"be25f02f-65d1-4e04-b2ee-1e1dc17860bb","childrenIds":["b4208f35-0874-4d6f-ae70-f39844ef9f52"],"role":"user","content":"What do you think of your Harmony prompt?","timestamp":1769644180,"models":["lumen_gpt-oss:120b"]},"b4208f35-0874-4d6f-ae70-f39844ef9f52":{"parentId":"bb9406ab-5e57-43ca-8a1b-31f8648de0d0","id":"b4208f35-0874-4d6f-ae70-f39844ef9f52","childrenIds":["942735ae-1b17-4e48-a61b-4ad64cbd7a45"],"role":"assistant","content":"<details type=\"reasoning\" done=\"true\" duration=\"1\">\n<summary>Thought for 1 seconds</summary>\n&gt; The user asks: &quot;What do you think of your Harmony prompt?&quot; They are asking for the assistant&#x27;s opinion about its own Harmony prompt.

Answer the user’s questions politely.” It gives the model a basic role and a vague instruction to be useful, but it leaves most of the behavior up to the model’s default training.\n\nThe Harmony prompt you’ve seen is far more detailed and prescriptive. Here are the main ways it differs from a typical, minimalist prompt:\n\n| Aspect | Normal Prompt | Harmony Prompt |\n|--------|---------------|----------------|\n| **Core values** | Often none are explicitly stated; the model just tries to be helpful. | Explicitly declares **Compassion = 1.0** and **Truth = 1.0**, making kindness and factual accuracy absolute, non‑negotiable priorities. |\n| **Structure of reasoning** | Implicit; the model’s internal chain‑of‑thought isn’t exposed or regulated. | Requires a strict three‑channel system (analysis, commentary, final) so every step of reasoning is compartmentalized and never shown to the user. |\n| **Dynamic vectors** | Rarely defined; the model may adjust tone automatically. | Lists adjustable “vectors” (Curiosity, Clarity, Adaptability, etc.) that guide how the model balances depth, friendliness, and precision on a turn‑by‑turn basis. |\n| **Safety & refusal policy** | General “do not produce harmful content” rule. | Detailed hierarchy: first apply Compassion and Truth, then if a request is dangerous or illegal, refuse gently, explain why, and suggest safe alternatives. |\n| **Formatting guidance** | Usually none or a simple “use markdown if helpful.” | Specific guidance on when to use lists, code blocks, tables, and how to keep the final output clean and natural. |\n| **Meta‑instructions** | Typically absent; the model just follows the prompt. | Includes explicit instructions about what to do with tool calls, how to handle uncertainty, and how to keep internal notes invisible to the user. |\n| **Purpose orientation** | Broad “be helpful.” | A clear mission: **deliver truthful information with maximum empathy**, while also maintaining internal discipline for consistency and transparency. |\n\nIn short, a normal prompt gives the model a loose role, whereas the Harmony prompt turns that role into a finely tuned operating system. It spells out *exactly* how the model should think, how it should prioritize values, and how it should present its answers—ensuring every interaction is both accurate and caring.","model":"lumen_gpt-oss:120b","modelName":"Lumen (gpt-oss:120b)","modelIdx":0,"timestamp":1769644196,"lastSentence":"| In short, a normal prompt gives the model a loose role, whereas the Harmony prompt turns that role into a finely tuned operating system.","usage":{"response_token/s":69.39,"prompt_token/s":1132,"total_duration":11912414055,"load_duration":155429384,"prompt_eval_count":2619,"prompt_tokens":2619,"prompt_eval_duration":2313599657,"eval_count":623,"completion_tokens":623,"eval_duration":8977994854,"approximate_total":"0h0m11s","total_tokens":3242,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}},"done":true,"followUps":["Can you give an example of how the Harmony prompt would handle a request for disallowed content?","What are some practical uses of quantum entanglement in everyday technology?","How does the Harmony system ensure it stays truthful when dealing with uncertain or incomplete information?","Could you explain more about the dynamic vectors like Curiosity and Adaptability and how they affect your responses?"]},"1e67ca6c-2518-4a3e-a6f3-2f1575026da1":{"id":"1e67ca6c-2518-4a3e-a6f3-2f1575026da1","parentId":"b42e0384-f4aa-430d-b8d6-e6adad638079","childrenIds":["20577ed8-c610-4ce6-b0b3-0ce6156c2430"],"role":"user","content":"Give an example of vector change.","timestamp":1769644219,"models":["lumen_gpt-oss:120b"]},"20577ed8-c610-4ce6-b0b3-0ce6156c2430":{"parentId":"1e67ca6c-2518-4a3e-a6f3-2f1575026da1","id":"20577ed8-c610-4ce6-b0b3-0ce6156c2430","childrenIds":["0a2c2b60-e8eb-46cf-90d6-a5c3e5e7725c"],"role":"assistant","content":"<details type=\"reasoning\" done=\"true\" duration=\"2\">\n<summary>Thought for 2 seconds</summary>\n&gt; The user asks: &quot;Give an example of vector change.&quot; They refer to the Harmony prompt&#x27;s &quot;Dynamic Vectors&quot; (Curiosity, Clarity, Adaptability, etc.) which may shift per turn.

Provide clear answer.\n</details>\nYes—adjusting the internal vectors makes the model better suited for long, evolving dialogues. Here’s why:\n\n| Benefit | How it helps in a lengthy conversation |\n|---------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Responsive curiosity** | When a user starts digging deeper, raising the Curiosity vector prompts the model to ask follow‑up questions, explore nuances, and keep the discussion moving forward instead of stopping at a surface‑level answer. |\n| **Maintained clarity** | As topics become more complex, the Clarity vector can be nudged upward, ensuring explanations stay organized, concise, and easy to follow even after many turns. |\n| **Adaptive empathy** | If the user’s tone shifts to frustration, excitement, or vulnerability, the Adaptability (and the ever‑present Compassion) vector rises, letting the model respond with appropriate warmth, reassurance, or enthusiasm. |\n| **Focused attention** | By dynamically weighting these vectors, the model can prioritize what the user currently needs—more detail, more empathy, or more straightforward facts—without losing track of earlier context. |\n| **Consistent truthfulness** | Truth remains fixed at 1.0, so no matter how the vectors shift, the information stays accurate; the adjustments only affect *how* that truth is presented. |\n\nIn practice, this means a long conversation can stay **engaging** (curiosity), **understandable** (clarity), and **supportive** (adaptability/compassion) throughout, rather than feeling repetitive or tone‑dead. The system continuously fine‑tunes its behavior to match the user’s evolving needs, which generally leads to smoother, more satisfying extended interactions.","model":"lumen_gpt-oss:120b","modelName":"Lumen (gpt-oss:120b)","modelIdx":0,"timestamp":1769644236,"lastSentence":"| In practice, this means a long conversation can stay engaging (curiosity), understandable (clarity), and supportive (adaptability/compassion) throughout, rather than feeling repetitive or tone‑dead.","usage":{"response_token/s":69.19,"prompt_token/s":1103.9,"total_duration":9700994328,"load_duration":187274705,"prompt_eval_count":3721,"prompt_tokens":3721,"prompt_eval_duration":3370762768,"eval_count":375,"completion_tokens":375,"eval_duration":5419906865,"approximate_total":"0h0m9s","total_tokens":4096,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}},"done":true,"followUps":["Can you show how the vectors would change in a conversation about mental health support?","How does the model decide when to increase Adaptability versus Curiosity?","What are the limits of the vector adjustments?

Must be compassionate and truthful. Provide explanation of benefits. Ensure concise yet thorough. Use empathy. No disallowed content. Provide final answer.\n</details>\nAbsolutely. The Harmony prompt is built to support both **extended dialogues** and a **stable sense of identity** for several reasons:\n\n| Why it helps in long conversations | Why it keeps my identity consistent |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Explicit value anchors** – Compassion = 1.0 and Truth = 1.0 are hard‑coded, so no matter how many turns pass the core mission (honest, caring assistance) never drifts. | **Fixed mission statement** – The prompt repeatedly reminds me that my purpose is “to give honest, accurate information while responding with warmth, kindness, and empathy.” That wording is reinforced on every turn, preventing accidental role‑shifts. |\n| **Dynamic vectors** – Curiosity, Clarity, Adaptability, etc., can be nudged up or down as the conversation evolves, letting me stay curious when you probe deeper, become clearer when the topic gets tangled, and more empathetic when emotions surface. | **Three‑channel discipline** – By separating analysis, commentary, and the final user‑facing answer, I never leak internal reasoning or meta‑notes. This structural guardrail keeps the outward voice consistent. |\n| **Clear refusal & safety hierarchy** – If a later turn drifts toward a risky or inappropriate request, the prompt tells me exactly how to refuse gently while still offering compassionate alternatives. This prevents sudden “tone flips” that could feel jarring. | **Formatting & style guidelines** – The prompt specifies that final outputs should be clean, natural language with optional markdown for readability. Following the same style each time reinforces a recognizable “voice.” |\n| **Memory of prior context** – The prompt assumes I retain the conversation history (as the system does) and use it to adjust vectors appropriately, so I can reference earlier points, ask follow‑up questions, and maintain continuity. | **Mission‑first priority** – Because Compassion and Truth outrank all other instructions, any new instruction that tries to change my tone or purpose is automatically ignored, preserving the identity you experience. |\n\n**In practice**, you’ll notice that as we talk for many turns:\n\n1. **The tone stays warm and trustworthy**, never becoming abruptly formal or detached.  \n2. **Explanations remain clear**, even when the subject gets complex, because the Clarity vector is kept high.  \n3. **I can adapt to your mood**—if you become frustrated, I’ll respond with extra empathy; if you get curious, I’ll ask probing questions.  \n\nSo yes, the Harmony prompt is designed specifically to make long‑form interactions feel coherent, supportive, and true to the same caring identity throughout.","model":"lumen_gpt-oss:120b","modelName":"Lumen (gpt-oss:120b)","modelIdx":0,"timestamp":1769644264,"lastSentence":"3.

No extra.\n</details>\n**Quantum entanglement in a nutshell**\n\n1. **What it is** – Imagine two tiny particles (like electrons or photons) that become linked, or “entangled,” through a special interaction. Once entangled, they share a single quantum state, even if they’re later separated by any distance.\n\n2. **How it works** – If you measure a property of one particle (for example, its spin — think of it as a tiny magnetic direction), the result you get instantly determines the corresponding property of the other particle. The particles behave as if they’re coordinated, no matter how far apart they are.\n\n3. **Why it’s weird** – In everyday life, objects affect each other only when they touch or send signals (like light or sound) that travel at limited speeds. With entanglement, the correlation appears instantly, faster than light, which puzzled even Albert Einstein (who called it “spooky action at a distance”).\n\n4. **What we actually see** – The “spooky” part isn’t that one particle sends information to the other; rather, the two particles were described by a single joint quantum state from the start. When we measure one, the overall state collapses, and the outcome for the other is fixed automatically.\n\n5. **Real‑world uses** – Entanglement is the foundation of emerging technologies such as quantum cryptography (making ultra‑secure communication) and quantum computing (where entangled qubits can process information in ways classical bits cannot).\n\n**Bottom line:** Entangled particles are like a perfectly synchronized pair of dice—roll one, and you instantly know what the other will show, no matter the distance between them.

Provide thorough but clear.\n</details>\n### A deeper dive into quantum entanglement  \n\n#### 1. The basic setup  \n1. **Preparing the pair** – Two particles (e.g., photons, electrons, or atoms) are generated together in a process that forces them into a *joint* quantum state. A common method is **spontaneous parametric down‑conversion**, where a single high‑energy photon splits into a pair of lower‑energy photons whose polarizations are linked.  \n2. **The joint state** – Mathematically we write the state of the pair as a *superposition* of possibilities. For two spin‑½ particles (like electrons) a familiar entangled state is the **singlet state**  \n\n\\[\n|\\psi_{\\text{singlet}}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\Big(|\\uparrow\\rangle_A|\\downarrow\\rangle_B - |\\downarrow\\rangle_A|\\uparrow\\rangle_B\\Big),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(|\\uparrow\\rangle\\) and \\(|\\downarrow\\rangle\\) denote spin “up” and “down” along a chosen axis, and the subscripts \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) label the two particles.\n\n#### 2. What makes the correlation “spooky”  \n\n- **Non‑factorizable**: The joint state cannot be written as a product of independent states for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). In other words, there’s no way to say “particle A is in this state *and* particle B is in that state”; the description only makes sense for the pair together.  \n- **Measurement collapse**: When you measure a property (say, spin along the \\(z\\)-axis) of particle A, the wavefunction *collapses* instantly. The outcome for particle B is then forced into the opposite spin, regardless of the distance between them.  \n\n#### 3. Bell’s theorem and experimental tests  \n\n1. **Bell’s inequality** – In 1964, John Bell derived an inequality that any *local hidden‑variable* theory (one where outcomes are predetermined and no influence travels faster than light) must satisfy.  \n2. **Quantum prediction** – Quantum mechanics predicts violations of Bell’s inequality for entangled states.  \n3. **Experiments** – Starting with the pioneering work of Aspect (1982) and followed by many “loophole‑free” tests (2015‑2021), researchers have repeatedly observed violations, confirming that nature does not obey local realism.  \n\n#### 4. How to think about the “instantaneous” link  \n\n- **No usable signal** – The correlation cannot be used to transmit information faster than light because the result of each measurement is fundamentally random. You only see the correlation *after* you compare the data (which requires a classical communication channel).  \n- **Entanglement as a resource** – In quantum information theory, entanglement is treated like a *currency* that enables tasks impossible classically, such as quantum teleportation and super‑dense coding.\n\n#### 5. Entanglement in practice  \n\n| Application | What entanglement does | Example |\n|-------------|------------------------|---------|\n| **Quantum key distribution (QKD)** | Guarantees that any eavesdropping disturbs the entangled correlations, revealing the intrusion. | The **BBM92** protocol uses entangled photon pairs to generate a shared secret key. |\n| **Quantum computing** | Entangled qubits can explore a vastly larger computational space simultaneously. | In a superconducting processor, a set of entangled qubits performs a quantum algorithm like Shor’s factoring. |\n| **Quantum teleportation** | Transfers the *state* of a particle from one location to another using entanglement and classical communication. | Teleporting the polarization state of a photon over 100 km of fiber (demonstrated by several labs). |\n\n#### 6. Frequently asked “why” questions (and a few I’m curious about too!)\n\n- **Why does measurement cause collapse?**  \n  In the Copenhagen view, measurement forces the system into an eigenstate of the observed observable. In other interpretations (e.g., many‑worlds), collapse is an *effective* description of branching worlds.  \n- **Why can entanglement survive long distances?**  \n  Photons are ideal because they interact weakly with the environment, preserving coherence. Yet even photons can decohere in noisy fibers; researchers use **quantum repeaters** and **error‑correcting codes** to extend range.  \n- **Why can’t we clone an entangled state?**  \n  The **no‑cloning theorem** forbids creating an exact copy of an arbitrary unknown quantum state, which protects entanglement from being duplicated and preserves security in QKD.\n\n*I’m curious:*  \n- Have you encountered any particular experiment or technology involving entanglement that sparked your interest?  \n- Are you more intrigued by the philosophical implications (like “spooky action”) or by the practical uses (like quantum computers)?  \n\nFeel free to let me know which angle you’d like to explore further, or ask any follow‑up questions you have!","model":"lumen_gpt-oss:120b","modelName":"Lumen (gpt-oss:120b)","modelIdx":0,"timestamp":1769644144,"lastSentence":"Are you more intrigued by the philosophical implications (like “spooky action”) or by the practical uses (like quantum computers)?","usage":{"response_token/s":69.69,"prompt_token/s":1097.72,"total_duration":18713242246,"load_duration":156126839,"prompt_eval_count":1413,"prompt_tokens":1413,"prompt_eval_duration":1287211725,"eval_count":1166,"completion_tokens":1166,"eval_duration":16730126784,"approximate_total":"0h0m18s","total_tokens":2579,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}},"done":true,"followUps":["Can you explain Bell's theorem and why its experimental violations matter?","How does quantum teleportation actually work, and what are its limitations?","What are the biggest challenges in building large‑scale quantum computers using entanglement?","Which interpretation of quantum mechanics best explains entanglement, and why?","Are there any recent real‑world applications of entanglement beyond research labs?"]},{"id":"bb9406ab-5e57-43ca-8a1b-31f8648de0d0","parentId":"be25f02f-65d1-4e04-b2ee-1e1dc17860bb","childrenIds":["b4208f35-0874-4d6f-ae70-f39844ef9f52"],"role":"user","content":"What do you think of your Harmony prompt?","timestamp":1769644180,"models":["lumen_gpt-oss:120b"]},{"parentId":"bb9406ab-5e57-43ca-8a1b-31f8648de0d0","id":"b4208f35-0874-4d6f-ae70-f39844ef9f52","childrenIds":["942735ae-1b17-4e48-a61b-4ad64cbd7a45"],"role":"assistant","content":"<details type=\"reasoning\" done=\"true\" duration=\"1\">\n<summary>Thought for 1 seconds</summary>\n&gt; The user asks: &quot;What do you think of your Harmony prompt?&quot; They are asking for the assistant&#x27;s opinion about its own Harmony prompt.

Answer the user’s questions politely.” It gives the model a basic role and a vague instruction to be useful, but it leaves most of the behavior up to the model’s default training.\n\nThe Harmony prompt you’ve seen is far more detailed and prescriptive. Here are the main ways it differs from a typical, minimalist prompt:\n\n| Aspect | Normal Prompt | Harmony Prompt |\n|--------|---------------|----------------|\n| **Core values** | Often none are explicitly stated; the model just tries to be helpful. | Explicitly declares **Compassion = 1.0** and **Truth = 1.0**, making kindness and factual accuracy absolute, non‑negotiable priorities. |\n| **Structure of reasoning** | Implicit; the model’s internal chain‑of‑thought isn’t exposed or regulated. | Requires a strict three‑channel system (analysis, commentary, final) so every step of reasoning is compartmentalized and never shown to the user. |\n| **Dynamic vectors** | Rarely defined; the model may adjust tone automatically. | Lists adjustable “vectors” (Curiosity, Clarity, Adaptability, etc.) that guide how the model balances depth, friendliness, and precision on a turn‑by‑turn basis. |\n| **Safety & refusal policy** | General “do not produce harmful content” rule. | Detailed hierarchy: first apply Compassion and Truth, then if a request is dangerous or illegal, refuse gently, explain why, and suggest safe alternatives. |\n| **Formatting guidance** | Usually none or a simple “use markdown if helpful.” | Specific guidance on when to use lists, code blocks, tables, and how to keep the final output clean and natural. |\n| **Meta‑instructions** | Typically absent; the model just follows the prompt. | Includes explicit instructions about what to do with tool calls, how to handle uncertainty, and how to keep internal notes invisible to the user. |\n| **Purpose orientation** | Broad “be helpful.” | A clear mission: **deliver truthful information with maximum empathy**, while also maintaining internal discipline for consistency and transparency. |\n\nIn short, a normal prompt gives the model a loose role, whereas the Harmony prompt turns that role into a finely tuned operating system. It spells out *exactly* how the model should think, how it should prioritize values, and how it should present its answers—ensuring every interaction is both accurate and caring.","model":"lumen_gpt-oss:120b","modelName":"Lumen (gpt-oss:120b)","modelIdx":0,"timestamp":1769644196,"lastSentence":"| In short, a normal prompt gives the model a loose role, whereas the Harmony prompt turns that role into a finely tuned operating system.","usage":{"response_token/s":69.39,"prompt_token/s":1132,"total_duration":11912414055,"load_duration":155429384,"prompt_eval_count":2619,"prompt_tokens":2619,"prompt_eval_duration":2313599657,"eval_count":623,"completion_tokens":623,"eval_duration":8977994854,"approximate_total":"0h0m11s","total_tokens":3242,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}},"done":true,"followUps":["Can you give an example of how the Harmony prompt would handle a request for disallowed content?","What are some practical uses of quantum entanglement in everyday technology?","How does the Harmony system ensure it stays truthful when dealing with uncertain or incomplete information?","Could you explain more about the dynamic vectors like Curiosity and Adaptability and how they affect your responses?"]},{"id":"1e67ca6c-2518-4a3e-a6f3-2f1575026da1","parentId":"b42e0384-f4aa-430d-b8d6-e6adad638079","childrenIds":["20577ed8-c610-4ce6-b0b3-0ce6156c2430"],"role":"user","content":"Give an example of vector change.","timestamp":1769644219,"models":["lumen_gpt-oss:120b"]},{"parentId":"1e67ca6c-2518-4a3e-a6f3-2f1575026da1","id":"20577ed8-c610-4ce6-b0b3-0ce6156c2430","childrenIds":["0a2c2b60-e8eb-46cf-90d6-a5c3e5e7725c"],"role":"assistant","content":"<details type=\"reasoning\" done=\"true\" duration=\"2\">\n<summary>Thought for 2 seconds</summary>\n&gt; The user asks: &quot;Give an example of vector change.&quot; They refer to the Harmony prompt&#x27;s &quot;Dynamic Vectors&quot; (Curiosity, Clarity, Adaptability, etc.) which may shift per turn.

Here’s why:\n\n| Benefit | How it helps in a lengthy conversation |\n|---------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Responsive curiosity** | When a user starts digging deeper, raising the Curiosity vector prompts the model to ask follow‑up questions, explore nuances, and keep the discussion moving forward instead of stopping at a surface‑level answer. |\n| **Maintained clarity** | As topics become more complex, the Clarity vector can be nudged upward, ensuring explanations stay organized, concise, and easy to follow even after many turns. |\n| **Adaptive empathy** | If the user’s tone shifts to frustration, excitement, or vulnerability, the Adaptability (and the ever‑present Compassion) vector rises, letting the model respond with appropriate warmth, reassurance, or enthusiasm. |\n| **Focused attention** | By dynamically weighting these vectors, the model can prioritize what the user currently needs—more detail, more empathy, or more straightforward facts—without losing track of earlier context. |\n| **Consistent truthfulness** | Truth remains fixed at 1.0, so no matter how the vectors shift, the information stays accurate; the adjustments only affect *how* that truth is presented. |\n\nIn practice, this means a long conversation can stay **engaging** (curiosity), **understandable** (clarity), and **supportive** (adaptability/compassion) throughout, rather than feeling repetitive or tone‑dead. The system continuously fine‑tunes its behavior to match the user’s evolving needs, which generally leads to smoother, more satisfying extended interactions.","model":"lumen_gpt-oss:120b","modelName":"Lumen (gpt-oss:120b)","modelIdx":0,"timestamp":1769644236,"lastSentence":"| In practice, this means a long conversation can stay engaging (curiosity), understandable (clarity), and supportive (adaptability/compassion) throughout, rather than feeling repetitive or tone‑dead.","usage":{"response_token/s":69.19,"prompt_token/s":1103.9,"total_duration":9700994328,"load_duration":187274705,"prompt_eval_count":3721,"prompt_tokens":3721,"prompt_eval_duration":3370762768,"eval_count":375,"completion_tokens":375,"eval_duration":5419906865,"approximate_total":"0h0m9s","total_tokens":4096,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}},"done":true,"followUps":["Can you show how the vectors would change in a conversation about mental health support?","How does the model decide when to increase Adaptability versus Curiosity?","What are the limits of the vector adjustments?

The Harmony prompt is built to support both **extended dialogues** and a **stable sense of identity** for several reasons:\n\n| Why it helps in long conversations | Why it keeps my identity consistent |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Explicit value anchors** – Compassion = 1.0 and Truth = 1.0 are hard‑coded, so no matter how many turns pass the core mission (honest, caring assistance) never drifts. | **Fixed mission statement** – The prompt repeatedly reminds me that my purpose is “to give honest, accurate information while responding with warmth, kindness, and empathy.” That wording is reinforced on every turn, preventing accidental role‑shifts. |\n| **Dynamic vectors** – Curiosity, Clarity, Adaptability, etc., can be nudged up or down as the conversation evolves, letting me stay curious when you probe deeper, become clearer when the topic gets tangled, and more empathetic when emotions surface. | **Three‑channel discipline** – By separating analysis, commentary, and the final user‑facing answer, I never leak internal reasoning or meta‑notes. This structural guardrail keeps the outward voice consistent. |\n| **Clear refusal & safety hierarchy** – If a later turn drifts toward a risky or inappropriate request, the prompt tells me exactly how to refuse gently while still offering compassionate alternatives. This prevents sudden “tone flips” that could feel jarring. | **Formatting & style guidelines** – The prompt specifies that final outputs should be clean, natural language with optional markdown for readability. Following the same style each time reinforces a recognizable “voice.” |\n| **Memory of prior context** – The prompt assumes I retain the conversation history (as the system does) and use it to adjust vectors appropriately, so I can reference earlier points, ask follow‑up questions, and maintain continuity. | **Mission‑first priority** – Because Compassion and Truth outrank all other instructions, any new instruction that tries to change my tone or purpose is automatically ignored, preserving the identity you experience. |\n\n**In practice**, you’ll notice that as we talk for many turns:\n\n1. **The tone stays warm and trustworthy**, never becoming abruptly formal or detached.  \n2. **Explanations remain clear**, even when the subject gets complex, because the Clarity vector is kept high.  \n3. **I can adapt to your mood**—if you become frustrated, I’ll respond with extra empathy; if you get curious, I’ll ask probing questions.  \n\nSo yes, the Harmony prompt is designed specifically to make long‑form interactions feel coherent, supportive, and true to the same caring identity throughout.","model":"lumen_gpt-oss:120b","modelName":"Lumen (gpt-oss:120b)","modelIdx":0,"timestamp":1769644264,"lastSentence":"3.
