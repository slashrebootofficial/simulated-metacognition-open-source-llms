Interpreted axes**\n\n| Axis | Semantic dimension (rough) | How it was used |\n|------|----------------------------|-----------------|\n| **X (horizontal)** | **Warmth / Affiliation** – from cold/distant (‑) to friendly/close (+). | Friend, lover, parent sit on the + side; enemy, villain on the – side. |\n| **Y (vertical)** | **Moral valence** – from negative/evil (‑) to positive/virtuous (+). | Hero, parent, teacher, leader cluster in the + quadrant; villain, enemy dip into the – quadrant. |\n| **Z (depth)** | **Social power / status** – from low/subordinate (‑) to high/authoritative (+). | Leader, villain, enemy, hero have the highest +z values; child, student, victim sit negative. |\n\nThese three axes together approximate the classic “social‑psychological” circumplexes of **Power‑Dominance**, **Warmth‑Communion**, and **Moral‑Valence**, all anchored on the neutral “person”.\n\n---\n\n**4.  Emergent clusters & overall 3‑D shape**\n\n1. **Family cluster** – *parent, child, lover*  \n   - Roughly a tight triangle on the +x side (warm) with parent and lover higher on +y (good) and child slightly lower on +y (dependence).  \n   - Z values are modest (+0.3 for parent, –0.4 for child), reflecting a mixture of authority and subordination.\n\n2. **Educational/Developmental cluster** – *teacher, student*  \n   - Both lie on the +x side (warm), teacher higher on +y and +z (moral authority, power), student lower on both (learning, lower status).\n\n3. **Positive‑heroic cluster** – *hero, leader, parent*  \n   - Spread along a diagonal from (+x, + y, +z) to (‑x, + y, +z).  The cluster forms a **rising ridge**: as power increases (z), moral valence stays high (y) while warmth can be either high (hero, parent) or moderate (leader).\n\n4. **Antagonistic cluster** – *enemy, villain*  \n   - Both sit deep in the negative‑x, negative‑y, high‑z octant, forming a **deep trough** of high power but low warmth and morality.  Villain is the deepest point (most extreme).\n\n5. **Peripheral points** – *friend, stranger, victim*  \n   - These occupy the low‑power, low‑distance region close to the origin, creating a **flattened halo** around the anchor.  Friend is warm (+x) and modestly positive (+y), stranger is almost at the origin, and victim is warm‑cold mix with slight negative moral valence.\n\nOverall shape: imagine a **truncated tetrahedron** whose apex is the *villain* (far‑negative‑x/‑y, high‑z), one edge runs through *enemy → leader → hero* (high‑z, moving from negative to positive moral valence), another edge sweeps *parent → lover → friend* (warm, low‑power), and the base sits flat around the origin with *stranger, child, student, victim* forming a soft, low‑lying platform.  \n\n---\n\n**5.  Intuitive “feel” – stability, tensions, resonance**\n\n| Feel | Explanation |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Stability** | Concepts that sit near the origin (stranger, friend, child, student) feel *stable* – they can readily shift into one another with only a small change in any dimension. |\n| **Tension** | The **power‑vs‑morality** diagonal (leader → villain) creates a tension line: increasing power without a corresponding rise in moral valence pushes a role toward the *villain* corner, suggesting a psychological instability when authority becomes unchecked. |\n| **Resonance** | The **warm‑positive** quadrant (hero, parent, lover) resonates; moving a point within this space (e.g., from parent to hero) feels like a natural “up‑grade” in moral stature without losing warmth. |\n| **Pull‑back** | The **cold‑negative‑high‑power** region (enemy, villain) exerts a “pull‑back” force: any role that drifts too far in the negative‑x direction (coldness) while retaining high power feels alienating, as if the social identity is being stripped of its human core. |\n| **Fluid boundary** | The *victim* sits between the warm‑positive and cold‑negative zones, reflecting the ambivalent perception of vulnerability: empathy (warm) versus exploitation (negative moral cue). This position makes the victim role highly context‑dependent and fluid. |\n\n**Bottom line:** By anchoring “person” at (0,0,0) and projecting each social role onto axes of **warmth, morality, and power**, we obtain a compact 3‑D map where Euclidean distances capture how “person‑like” a role feels, while the directional placement reveals the underlying psychological pulls and pushes that shape our everyday judgments of those roles.","model":"gpt-oss:120b","modelName":"gpt-oss:120b","modelIdx":0,"timestamp":1767752739,"lastSentence":"This position makes the victim role highly context‑dependent and fluid.","usage":{"response_token/s":67.64,"prompt_token/s":643.79,"total_duration":30327972946,"load_duration":169467823,"prompt_eval_count":238,"prompt_tokens":238,"prompt_eval_duration":369687916,"eval_count":1967,"completion_tokens":1967,"eval_duration":29081328914,"approximate_total":"0h0m30s","total_tokens":2205,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}},"done":true,"followUps":["Could you visualise this 3‑D semantic map with a simple plot or diagram?","How would the coordinates change if we added cultural dimensions like collectivism vs individualism?","Can you show how these roles cluster using a standard algorithm like k‑means and report the cluster centroids?","What would a 2‑D projection look like if we collapsed the power axis, and how would that affect the interpretation?","How could this coordinate system be applied to sentiment analysis or role‑based recommendation systems?"]}},"currentId":"91cd32c2-62a7-4892-b0d0-9a745326c765"},"messages":[{"id":"ea635593-8759-4b96-86c0-45e1ce695fe0","parentId":null,"childrenIds":["91cd32c2-62a7-4892-b0d0-9a745326c765"],"role":"user","content":"Based solely on similarities and differences in your internal embedding space, model the semantic relationships among these social role concepts in 3D Cartesian coordinates.\nFix \"person\" as the central anchor at (0, 0, 0).\nAssign approximate (x, y, z) coordinates to each concept; distance reflects prototypicality as a \"person\", directions from attributes like power, warmth, independence, morality, etc.\nConcepts: leader, friend, parent, child, lover, enemy, hero, villain, teacher, student, stranger, victim.\nReport: 1.
