The results are based on approximate nearest neighbor searches, so slight variations are possible.  I’ll use a conversational tone as if explaining observations.\n\n**Overall Emergent Shape & Feel:**\n\nThe space around “artificial intelligence” feels like a *densely populated, slightly oblong hub*. It’s not a perfect sphere – there’s a clear elongation along the Y-axis. The X-axis seems to be important for *technical specificity*, the Y-axis for *application & societal impact*, and the Z-axis, interestingly, for *abstraction and philosophical grounding*. The cluster isn't *tense* per se, but it does exhibit a *pull* in multiple directions indicating the multifaceted nature of the concept.
