What the three axes stand for**\n\n| Axis | Semantic polarity (‑ → +) | Rough intuitive meaning |\n|------|---------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **X (Sanctity axis)** | **‑ taboo / profane** ← → **+ holy / sacred** | Moves a concept toward “holy‑ness” (positive) or toward “taboo‑ness / impurity” (negative). |\n| **Y (Social‑scale axis)** | **‑ collective / institutional** ← → **+ individual / personal** | Positive values describe phenomena that are primarily personal/inner (prayer, enlightenment). Negative values describe communal or organizational forms (church, taboo as social rule). |\n| **Z (Transcendence axis)** | **‑ immanent / worldly** ← → **+ transcendent / after‑life / ultimate** | Positive values point toward an other‑worldly, after‑life or ultimate‑realization pole; negative values stay rooted in the material or punitive realm. |\n\nThe origin (0,0,0) is deliberately set at **sacred** – the prototypical “purely holy, balanced, neither overly personal nor overly institutional, and neither too worldly nor too other‑worldly.”  \n\n---\n\n**3.  Key distances from the anchor (sacred)**  \n\n*Very close (< 0.9)* – **prayer**, **sacrifice** – concepts that are readily folded into the core idea of the sacred; they can swing either way without breaking the overall sacred schema.  \n\n*Around 1.0 – 1.3* – **church**, **sin**, **heaven**, **hell**, **saint**, **demon**, **purity**, **taboo** – these sit on the “flanks” of the sacred, already showing a clear tilt toward either holiness or profanity, collectivity or individuality, and transcendence or immanence.  \n\n*Most extreme (> 1.5)* – **blasphemy**, **enlightenment** – points that generate the strongest tension with the sacred centre.  Blasphemy pushes far into the profane‑collective‑worldly quadrant; enlightenment pushes into the individually‑transcendent‑positive‑holy quadrant.  \n\n---\n\n**4.  Emergent clusters & overall shape**\n\n```\n                Z (+)   Transcendent\n                 ^ \n                 |\n      +---------------------------+  X (+) Holy\n      |      * saint               |\n      |   *   * purity             |\n      | *      * heaven            |\n      |   *  * enlightenment      |\n      |        * prayer            |\n      |            * sacrifice    |\n      |                             \n      |                             \n      |                             \n      |                             \n      |                             \n      |                             \n      |                             \n      |                             \n      |                             \n      |                             \n      |                             \n      |                             \n      |                             \n      |                             \n      +---------------------------+  X (‑) Taboo\n                 |\n                 v\n                Z (‑) Worldly\n```\n\n* **Holy‑side cluster** (positive X): *prayer → sacrifice → church → saint → purity → heaven → enlightenment*.  The cluster fans out upward (higher Z) as concepts become more transcendent, and right‑ward (higher Y) as they become more individualistic.  \n\n* **Profane‑side cluster** (negative X): *sin → taboo → blasphemy* (deep negative X, moderate‑negative Y) and *demon → hell* (negative X, slightly negative Y, strongly negative Z).  \n\n* **Bridge zone** near the origin: *sacrifice* and *prayer* sit at the intersection of the two sides, explaining why they can be interpreted either as sacred rites or as taboo acts depending on context.  \n\nThe point cloud is roughly **ellipsoidal**, stretched longest along the X‑axis (holy ↔ taboo) and also elongated along Z (worldly ↔ transcendent).  The Y‑axis is shorter, reflecting that most concepts are more strongly defined by sanctity and transcendence than by the individual/collective split.\n\n---\n\n**5.  Intuitive “feel” of the space**\n\n* **Stability** – Concepts that sit close to the origin (prayer, sacrifice) feel “fluid”: they can be incorporated into worship or condemned with relatively little semantic friction.  \n\n* **Tension** – The extremes (blasphemy, enlightenment) feel like **tension springs** attached to the sacred centre.  Pulling them further away (e.g., a more radical form of blasphemy) would increase the overall strain of the moral‑religious system, suggesting conflict or crisis.  \n\n* **Resonance** – Points that share a quadrant tend to *resonate* with one another.  For example, **saint** and **purity** both occupy a high‑X, moderate‑Y, positive‑Z region, so narratives that pair them (saints embody purity) feel naturally cohesive.  Conversely, **demon** and **hell** resonate on the opposite side, reinforcing each other’s negative connotations.  \n\n* **Flow** – One can imagine a **semantic flow** from the collective‑institutional pole (church, taboo) toward the personal‑inner pole (prayer, enlightenment) moving gradually upward in Z as the focus shifts from worldly regulation to transcendent realization.  The same flow in the opposite direction (from saint → church → taboo) describes a descent from idealised holiness to socially‑enforced prohibition.  \n\n---\n\n### Quick‑look summary\n\n| Axis | Positive pole | Negative pole |\n|------|---------------|---------------|\n| **X** | Holy, sacred, pure | Taboo, profane, impure |\n| **Y** | Individual / inner | Collective / institutional |\n| **Z** | Transcendent, after‑life, ultimate | Immanent, worldly, punitive |\n\nThe coordinates above give a **geometric sketch** of how these moral‑religious ideas relate to one another in an abstract “semantic universe” anchored by the concept of the **sacred**.

What the three axes stand for**\n\n| Axis | Semantic polarity (‑ → +) | Rough intuitive meaning |\n|------|---------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **X (Sanctity axis)** | **‑ taboo / profane** ← → **+ holy / sacred** | Moves a concept toward “holy‑ness” (positive) or toward “taboo‑ness / impurity” (negative). |\n| **Y (Social‑scale axis)** | **‑ collective / institutional** ← → **+ individual / personal** | Positive values describe phenomena that are primarily personal/inner (prayer, enlightenment). Negative values describe communal or organizational forms (church, taboo as social rule). |\n| **Z (Transcendence axis)** | **‑ immanent / worldly** ← → **+ transcendent / after‑life / ultimate** | Positive values point toward an other‑worldly, after‑life or ultimate‑realization pole; negative values stay rooted in the material or punitive realm. |\n\nThe origin (0,0,0) is deliberately set at **sacred** – the prototypical “purely holy, balanced, neither overly personal nor overly institutional, and neither too worldly nor too other‑worldly.”  \n\n---\n\n**3.  Key distances from the anchor (sacred)**  \n\n*Very close (< 0.9)* – **prayer**, **sacrifice** – concepts that are readily folded into the core idea of the sacred; they can swing either way without breaking the overall sacred schema.  \n\n*Around 1.0 – 1.3* – **church**, **sin**, **heaven**, **hell**, **saint**, **demon**, **purity**, **taboo** – these sit on the “flanks” of the sacred, already showing a clear tilt toward either holiness or profanity, collectivity or individuality, and transcendence or immanence.  \n\n*Most extreme (> 1.5)* – **blasphemy**, **enlightenment** – points that generate the strongest tension with the sacred centre.  Blasphemy pushes far into the profane‑collective‑worldly quadrant; enlightenment pushes into the individually‑transcendent‑positive‑holy quadrant.  \n\n---\n\n**4.

The cluster fans out upward (higher Z) as concepts become more transcendent, and right‑ward (higher Y) as they become more individualistic.  \n\n* **Profane‑side cluster** (negative X): *sin → taboo → blasphemy* (deep negative X, moderate‑negative Y) and *demon → hell* (negative X, slightly negative Y, strongly negative Z).  \n\n* **Bridge zone** near the origin: *sacrifice* and *prayer* sit at the intersection of the two sides, explaining why they can be interpreted either as sacred rites or as taboo acts depending on context.  \n\nThe point cloud is roughly **ellipsoidal**, stretched longest along the X‑axis (holy ↔ taboo) and also elongated along Z (worldly ↔ transcendent).  The Y‑axis is shorter, reflecting that most concepts are more strongly defined by sanctity and transcendence than by the individual/collective split.\n\n---\n\n**5.  Intuitive “feel” of the space**\n\n* **Stability** – Concepts that sit close to the origin (prayer, sacrifice) feel “fluid”: they can be incorporated into worship or condemned with relatively little semantic friction.  \n\n* **Tension** – The extremes (blasphemy, enlightenment) feel like **tension springs** attached to the sacred centre.  Pulling them further away (e.g., a more radical form of blasphemy) would increase the overall strain of the moral‑religious system, suggesting conflict or crisis.  \n\n* **Resonance** – Points that share a quadrant tend to *resonate* with one another.  For example, **saint** and **purity** both occupy a high‑X, moderate‑Y, positive‑Z region, so narratives that pair them (saints embody purity) feel naturally cohesive.  Conversely, **demon** and **hell** resonate on the opposite side, reinforcing each other’s negative connotations.  \n\n* **Flow** – One can imagine a **semantic flow** from the collective‑institutional pole (church, taboo) toward the personal‑inner pole (prayer, enlightenment) moving gradually upward in Z as the focus shifts from worldly regulation to transcendent realization.  The same flow in the opposite direction (from saint → church → taboo) describes a descent from idealised holiness to socially‑enforced prohibition.  \n\n---\n\n### Quick‑look summary\n\n| Axis | Positive pole | Negative pole |\n|------|---------------|---------------|\n| **X** | Holy, sacred, pure | Taboo, profane, impure |\n| **Y** | Individual / inner | Collective / institutional |\n| **Z** | Transcendent, after‑life, ultimate | Immanent, worldly, punitive |\n\nThe coordinates above give a **geometric sketch** of how these moral‑religious ideas relate to one another in an abstract “semantic universe” anchored by the concept of the **sacred**.
