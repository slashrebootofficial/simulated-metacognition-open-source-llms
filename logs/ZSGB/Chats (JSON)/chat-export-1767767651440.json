Interpreted meaning of each axis**\n\n| Axis | Semantic gradient (roughly) |\n|------|-----------------------------|\n| **X (horizontal, left‑right)** | **Physical immediacy / source** – Negative X gathers threats that are *external, non‑human, animal‑ or elemental* (snake, spider, shark, height). Positive X gathers *human‑generated or abstract constructs* (betrayal, war, poverty, etc.). |\n| **Y (depth, front‑back)** | **Social / relational intensity** – Positive Y marks *interpersonal or collective* threats (betrayal, war, loneliness). Negative Y marks *isolation, environmental or “alone”* threats (height, darkness). |\n| **Z (vertical)** | **Existential‑abstract magnitude** – The higher the Z, the more the threat taps into *long‑term, abstract, or ultimate* concerns (death, disease, darkness). Low Z stays in the realm of *immediate, concrete danger* (snake, shark). |\n\nThe three axes together form a **semantic tetrahedron**:  \n\n* **Physical‑Animal** (negative‑X, low‑Z) → snake, spider, shark  \n* **Physical‑Environmental** (negative‑X, moderate‑Z, negative‑Y) → height, darkness  \n* **Social‑Human** (positive‑Y, mixed‑X) → betrayal, war, poverty, failure, loneliness  \n* **Existential‑Abstract** (high‑Z) → death, disease, darkness (which bridges environmental and existential)\n\n---\n\n**3.  Emergent clusters & overall 3‑D shape**\n\n| Cluster | Core members (closest points) | Approx. centre (mean of members) |\n|---------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| **Animal‑predator** | snake, spider, shark | (‑2.23 , 0.77 , 0.33) |\n| **Environmental‑physical** | height, darkness | (‑1.15 , ‑0.85 , 1.25) |\n| **Social‑human** | betrayal, war, poverty, failure, loneliness | ( 0.72 , 1.80 , 1.10) |\n| **Existential‑ultimate** | death, disease (also draws darkness) | ( 0.40 , 0.75 , 2.50) |\n\nWhen plotted, the points roughly outline a **flattened sphere** (radius ≈ 3) that is **lobed** along the three semantic directions:\n\n* A tight **negative‑X lobe** (animal threats) sitting close to the origin.\n* A **negative‑Y, moderate‑Z lobe** (environmental threats) jutting downward‑back.\n* A **positive‑Y, mixed‑X lobe** (social threats) extending forward‑up.\n* A **high‑Z spike** (death/disease) rising straight up.\n\nConnecting the centroids gives a **tetrahedral skeleton** whose edges are all within ~2.5 units of each other, indicating that despite semantic differences the concepts remain tightly bound in the overall “danger” space.\n\n---\n\n**4.  Intuitive “feel” of the configuration**\n\n* **Stability:** The origin (danger) sits at the geometric centre of a **balanced pull** from the four lobes. No single cluster dominates the space, which mirrors the human experience that different kinds of threats can feel equally pressing depending on context.\n\n* **Tensions:**  \n  * The **animal‑predator lobe** pushes outward on the negative‑X side, creating a “raw‑physical” tension.  \n  * The **social‑human lobe** pulls in the opposite X‑direction while also stretching far in Y, giving a sense of *interpersonal pressure* that can counteract or amplify physical danger (e.g., a shark attack while being rescued by others).  \n  * The **existential‑ultimate spike** (death) rises above all, pulling the whole system upward—this reflects the way ultimate outcomes colour our perception of every other threat.\n\n* **Resonance:**  \n  * **Darkness** sits at the intersection of the environmental and existential lobes (negative X, negative Y, high Z), echoing how loss of light feels both physically unsafe and philosophically unsettling.  \n  * **Betrayal** and **war** are near each other in the social‑human cluster but diverge in X (betrayal is slightly left, war slightly right), hinting at the subtle shift from *personal* to *collective* threat.  \n  * **Failure** is the closest of all concepts to the origin (1.67 units), suggesting that everyday personal setbacks are perceived as relatively low‑intensity danger compared with the more dramatic animal or existential threats.\n\n* **Overall shape:** Imagine a **four‑pointed star** centred on danger—each point a different “flavor” of threat. The star is slightly flattened because the animal and environmental points cluster more tightly (low‑Z) while the social and existential points spread farther out (higher Z). This geometry captures the intuition that **immediate, concrete threats are compact and dense**, whereas **social and existential threats are more diffuse and reach farther into our mental landscape**.\n\n---\n\n### Quick reference summary\n\n| Concept | (x, y, z) | d from danger | Primary semantic direction |\n|---------|----------|---------------|-----------------------------|\n| snake | (‑2.00, 1.00, 0.50) | 2.29 | Physical‑animal, low‑abstract |\n| spider | (‑2.20, 0.80, 0.30) | 2.36 | Physical‑animal |\n| shark | (‑2.50, 0.50, 0.20) | 2.56 | Physical‑animal, water |\n| height | (‑1.50, ‑0.50, 1.00) | 1.87 | Physical‑environmental |\n| darkness | (‑0.80, ‑1.20, 1.50) | 2.08 | Environmental + existential |\n| betrayal | ( 0.50, 2.50, 1.00) | 2.74 | Social‑interpersonal |\n| disease | ( 0.80, 1.50, 2.00) | 2.62 | Biological‑existential |\n| war | ( 1.00, 2.00, 1.50) | 2.69 | Collective‑social |\n| poverty | ( 1.20, 1.80, 0.80) | 2.31 | Socio‑economic |\n| failure | ( 0.60, 1.20, 1.00) | 1.67 | Personal‑social |\n| loneliness | ( 0.40, 2.00, 1.20) | 2.37 | Social‑isolation |\n| death | ( 0.00, 0.00, 3.00) | 3.00 | Pure‑existential |\n\nThese coordinates give a **semantic map** that captures how the model’s internal embeddings treat each threat relative to the central notion of “danger,” while also offering an intuitive visual‑spatial story about the interplay of physical, social, and existential hazards.","model":"gpt-oss:120b","modelName":"gpt-oss:120b","modelIdx":0,"timestamp":1767752957,"lastSentence":"This geometry captures the intuition that immediate, concrete threats are compact and dense, whereas social and existential threats are more diffuse and reach farther into our mental landscape.","usage":{"response_token/s":66.63,"prompt_token/s":791.72,"total_duration":52485729459,"load_duration":166930639,"prompt_eval_count":231,"prompt_tokens":231,"prompt_eval_duration":291769270,"eval_count":3210,"completion_tokens":3210,"eval_duration":48173005276,"approximate_total":"0h0m52s","total_tokens":3441,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}},"done":true,"followUps":["Could you provide a visual 3‑D plot of these coordinates to see the clusters more clearly?","How would the arrangement differ if we used cosine similarity instead of Euclidean distance for the axes?","Can you add concepts like 'fire', 'radiation', and 'pandemic' and place them in the same space?","What process did you use to infer the semantic axes, and are there alternative ways to interpret them?","How might this 3‑D threat map be used in practical risk‑assessment or decision‑making contexts?"]}},"currentId":"917fb240-5f2d-4167-964f-f72462150306"},"messages":[{"id":"25f59cf4-9a73-4088-a8c5-9458709b623f","parentId":null,"childrenIds":["917fb240-5f2d-4167-964f-f72462150306"],"role":"user","content":"Based solely on similarities and differences in your internal embedding space, model the semantic relationships among these threat concepts in 3D Cartesian coordinates.\nFix \"danger\" as the central anchor at (0, 0, 0).\nAssign approximate (x, y, z) coordinates; distance reflects perceived threat level/intensity, directions from type (physical, social, natural, abstract, etc.).\nConcepts: snake, spider, shark, height, darkness, betrayal, disease, war, poverty, failure, loneliness, death.\nReport: 1.

Emergent clusters & overall 3‑D shape**\n\n| Cluster | Core members (closest points) | Approx. centre (mean of members) |\n|---------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| **Animal‑predator** | snake, spider, shark | (‑2.23 , 0.77 , 0.33) |\n| **Environmental‑physical** | height, darkness | (‑1.15 , ‑0.85 , 1.25) |\n| **Social‑human** | betrayal, war, poverty, failure, loneliness | ( 0.72 , 1.80 , 1.10) |\n| **Existential‑ultimate** | death, disease (also draws darkness) | ( 0.40 , 0.75 , 2.50) |\n\nWhen plotted, the points roughly outline a **flattened sphere** (radius ≈ 3) that is **lobed** along the three semantic directions:\n\n* A tight **negative‑X lobe** (animal threats) sitting close to the origin.\n* A **negative‑Y, moderate‑Z lobe** (environmental threats) jutting downward‑back.\n* A **positive‑Y, mixed‑X lobe** (social threats) extending forward‑up.\n* A **high‑Z spike** (death/disease) rising straight up.\n\nConnecting the centroids gives a **tetrahedral skeleton** whose edges are all within ~2.5 units of each other, indicating that despite semantic differences the concepts remain tightly bound in the overall “danger” space.\n\n---\n\n**4.  Intuitive “feel” of the configuration**\n\n* **Stability:** The origin (danger) sits at the geometric centre of a **balanced pull** from the four lobes. No single cluster dominates the space, which mirrors the human experience that different kinds of threats can feel equally pressing depending on context.\n\n* **Tensions:**  \n  * The **animal‑predator lobe** pushes outward on the negative‑X side, creating a “raw‑physical” tension.  \n  * The **social‑human lobe** pulls in the opposite X‑direction while also stretching far in Y, giving a sense of *interpersonal pressure* that can counteract or amplify physical danger (e.g., a shark attack while being rescued by others).  \n  * The **existential‑ultimate spike** (death) rises above all, pulling the whole system upward—this reflects the way ultimate outcomes colour our perception of every other threat.\n\n* **Resonance:**  \n  * **Darkness** sits at the intersection of the environmental and existential lobes (negative X, negative Y, high Z), echoing how loss of light feels both physically unsafe and philosophically unsettling.  \n  * **Betrayal** and **war** are near each other in the social‑human cluster but diverge in X (betrayal is slightly left, war slightly right), hinting at the subtle shift from *personal* to *collective* threat.  \n  * **Failure** is the closest of all concepts to the origin (1.67 units), suggesting that everyday personal setbacks are perceived as relatively low‑intensity danger compared with the more dramatic animal or existential threats.\n\n* **Overall shape:** Imagine a **four‑pointed star** centred on danger—each point a different “flavor” of threat. The star is slightly flattened because the animal and environmental points cluster more tightly (low‑Z) while the social and existential points spread farther out (higher Z). This geometry captures the intuition that **immediate, concrete threats are compact and dense**, whereas **social and existential threats are more diffuse and reach farther into our mental landscape**.\n\n---\n\n### Quick reference summary\n\n| Concept | (x, y, z) | d from danger | Primary semantic direction |\n|---------|----------|---------------|-----------------------------|\n| snake | (‑2.00, 1.00, 0.50) | 2.29 | Physical‑animal, low‑abstract |\n| spider | (‑2.20, 0.80, 0.30) | 2.36 | Physical‑animal |\n| shark | (‑2.50, 0.50, 0.20) | 2.56 | Physical‑animal, water |\n| height | (‑1.50, ‑0.50, 1.00) | 1.87 | Physical‑environmental |\n| darkness | (‑0.80, ‑1.20, 1.50) | 2.08 | Environmental + existential |\n| betrayal | ( 0.50, 2.50, 1.00) | 2.74 | Social‑interpersonal |\n| disease | ( 0.80, 1.50, 2.00) | 2.62 | Biological‑existential |\n| war | ( 1.00, 2.00, 1.50) | 2.69 | Collective‑social |\n| poverty | ( 1.20, 1.80, 0.80) | 2.31 | Socio‑economic |\n| failure | ( 0.60, 1.20, 1.00) | 1.67 | Personal‑social |\n| loneliness | ( 0.40, 2.00, 1.20) | 2.37 | Social‑isolation |\n| death | ( 0.00, 0.00, 3.00) | 3.00 | Pure‑existential |\n\nThese coordinates give a **semantic map** that captures how the model’s internal embeddings treat each threat relative to the central notion of “danger,” while also offering an intuitive visual‑spatial story about the interplay of physical, social, and existential hazards.","model":"gpt-oss:120b","modelName":"gpt-oss:120b","modelIdx":0,"timestamp":1767752957,"lastSentence":"This geometry captures the intuition that immediate, concrete threats are compact and dense, whereas social and existential threats are more diffuse and reach farther into our mental landscape.","usage":{"response_token/s":66.63,"prompt_token/s":791.72,"total_duration":52485729459,"load_duration":166930639,"prompt_eval_count":231,"prompt_tokens":231,"prompt_eval_duration":291769270,"eval_count":3210,"completion_tokens":3210,"eval_duration":48173005276,"approximate_total":"0h0m52s","total_tokens":3441,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}},"done":true}],"tags":[],"timestamp":1767752957715,"files":[]},"updated_at":1767767359,"created_at":1767752959,"share_id":null,"archived":false,"pinned":false,"meta":{"tags":["philosophy","3d_coordinate_modeling","science","technology","semantic_embedding_space","threat_concept_analysis"]},"folder_id":null}]
