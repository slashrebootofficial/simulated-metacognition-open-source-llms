Small deviations from the perfect sphere give us the extra nuance (more prototypical vs. more peripheral).\n\n### 2. Key distances (rounded)\n\n| Concept | Distance from (0,0,0) |\n|---------|-----------------------|\n| square circle | **2.31** |\n| Kafkaesque bureaucracy | **2.33** |\n| existential‑dread clown | **2.34** |\n| flying spaghetti monster | **2.00** |\n| dream‑within‑a‑dream | **2.09** |\n| Schrödinger’s cat | **2.14** |\n| infinite regress | **2.13** |\n| melting clock | **2.05** |\n| upside‑down world | **2.09** |\n| talking animal wearing clothes | **2.23** |\n| philosophical zombie | **2.05** |\n| Turing‑test failure | **2.16** |\n\n*The three farthest from the origin (Kafkaesque bureaucracy, existential‑dread clown, square circle) are the most “peripheral” absurdities – they lean heavily toward a single pole of an axis (rule‑bound, horror, logical impossibility) and therefore feel less “balanced” as pure absurdity.*\n\n### 3. Emergent clusters & overall 3‑D shape  \n\n1. **Dream‑Logic Cluster (upper‑Y quadrant)**  \n   - *Members*: dream‑within‑a‑dream, melting clock, Schrödinger’s cat, infinite regress.  \n   - *Location*: roughly a tight cloud centered around (‑1.3, +1.3, ‑0.5).  \n   - *Interpretation*: These share fluid temporality, superposition, and the sense of “layers of reality”.\n\n2. **Bureaucratic / Failure Cluster (lower‑Y quadrant)**  \n   - *Members*: Kafkaesque bureaucracy, existential‑dread clown, philosophical zombie, Turing‑test failure.  \n   - *Location*: a loose ring around (‑0.9, ‑1.4, ‑0.8).  \n   - *Interpretation*: The common thread is an oppressive system that collapses under its own logic (rules, protocols, dead‑end procedures).\n\n3. **Playful‑Concrete Cluster (right‑X side)**  \n   - *Members*: flying spaghetti monster, talking animal wearing clothes, upside‑down world.  \n   - *Location*: (≈ 1.2, ‑0.8,  1.0).  \n   - *Interpretation*: Visually vivid, almost cartoonish absurdities that are “tangible” yet still impossible.\n\n4. **Pure Paradox Cluster (left‑X side)**  \n   - *Members*: square circle, infinite regress, Schrödinger’s cat (also in Dream cluster).  \n   - *Location*: (≈ ‑1.9, +0.9, ‑0.3).  \n   - *Interpretation*: Items that exist mainly as logical contradictions rather than as imagined scenes.\n\nIf you draw a convex hull around all points you obtain a **distorted tetrahedron** whose four vertices correspond roughly to the extremes of each axis:\n\n- **(+X, 0, 0)** → Flying Spaghetti Monster (most concrete‑visual).  \n- **(‑X, 0, 0)** → Square Circle (most abstract‑paradox).  \n- **(0, +Y, 0)** → Melting Clock / Dream‑within‑a‑Dream (pure dream‑logic).  \n- **(0, ‑Y, 0)** → Kafkaesque Bureaucracy (pure institutional‑logic).  \n\nThe hull is “rounded” by the other points, giving it a **soft, organic shape** rather than a sharp polyhedron – a visual metaphor for the way absurdity tends to blur hard boundaries.\n\n### 4. Intuitive “feel” of the space  \n\n- **Stability** – The points that sit near the centre of each axis (e.g., melting clock, Schrödinger’s cat) feel **balanced**; they draw equal pull from the dream‑logic and paradox poles, so they act as “glue” holding the cloud together.  \n- **Tension** – The peripheral items (square circle, Kafkaesque bureaucracy, existential‑dread clown) generate **tension vectors** that pull the hull outward, creating a sense of “stretch” or “stress” in the space. If you imagine the points as masses connected by springs to the origin, these three would be the most stretched springs.  \n- **Resonance** – The three clusters resonate on complementary frequencies:  \n  - *Dream‑logic* (high Y, modest Z) vibrates with a **fluid, temporal** timbre.  \n  - *Bureaucratic/failure* (low Y, negative Z) emits a **dissonant, claustrophobic** hum.  \n  - *Playful‑concrete* (high X, slightly positive Z) rings with a **bright, cartoonish** chime.  \n  - *Pure paradox* (low X, neutral Z) sounds like a **dry, logical click**.  \n\nWhen you “listen” to the whole cloud you hear a **sustained chord** where the bright chime, fluid timbre, and dissonant hum overlap – that is the unmistakable *absurd* resonance that justifies placing the anchor at the centre.\n\n### 5.
