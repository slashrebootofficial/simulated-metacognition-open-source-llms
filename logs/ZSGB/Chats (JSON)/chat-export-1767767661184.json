The reasoning behind the coordinates is detailed below, followed by the report.  I'm relying entirely on my internal embedding space – no external knowledge is being used.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n*   **Past-Future (X-axis):** Negative X for past, positive for future.  Stronger prototypicality/definition = closer to 0 on X.\n*   **Duration/Scale (Y-axis):** Lower Y for shorter durations, higher for longer.  \"Moment\" is very short, \"Eternity\" very long.\n*   **Cyclical vs. Linear/Personal vs. Abstract (Z-axis):** Positive Z for cyclical/personal time (e.g., childhood memories, nostalgia), negative for more abstract, linear time (e.g., a deadline).\n\n**Report:**\n\n**1. Coordinates:**\n\n*   **Yesterday:** (-0.7, 0.2, -0.3)\n*   **Today:** (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)  *This is the anchor relative to which everything is positioned.*\n*   **Tomorrow:** (0.8, 0.2, -0.3)\n*   **Childhood:** (-1.2, 0.5, 1.0)\n*   **Old Age:** (-1.8, 0.6, 0.8)\n*   **Eternity:** (0.0, 2.0, -0.5)\n*   **Moment:** (0.0, -0.3, -0.4)\n*   **Hour:** (0.0, 0.3, -0.5)\n*   **Century:** (0.0, 1.2, -0.6)\n*   **Deadline:** (0.9, 0.7, -1.3)\n*   **Nostalgia:** (-1.5, 0.4, 1.2)\n*   **Future:** (1.2, 0.3, -0.8)\n\n**2. Key Distances from Anchor (Time - 0,0,0):**\n\n*   **Closest:** Today (distance = 0)\n*   **Next Closest:** Yesterday & Tomorrow (approx. 0.7 distance)\n*   **Longest:** Eternity (approx. 2.0 distance)\n*   **Significant Past Distance:** Childhood & Old Age (approx. 1.3 - 1.8 distance)\n*   **Significant Future Distance:** Future (approx. 1.2 distance)\n*   **Significant Linear Distance:** Deadline (approx. 1.1 distance)\n*   **Significant Concrete Distance:** Hour (approx. 0.3 distance)\n\n**3. Interpreted Axes:**\n\n*   **X-axis (Past-Future):** Strongest differentiation along this axis.  Negative values = past; Positive values = future.  Proximity to zero indicates \"present-ness\" or concreteness.\n*   **Y-axis (Duration/Scale):**  Short durations are low, long durations are high.  \"Moment\" is the shortest, \"Eternity\" the longest.\n*   **Z-axis (Cyclical/Personal vs. Linear/Abstract):** Positive Z represents time experiences/feelings (childhood memories, nostalgia).  Negative Z represents more abstract, externally imposed time (deadlines).\n\n**4. Emergent Clusters or Overall 3D Shape:**\n\nThere's a general trend of concepts forming a slightly elongated ellipsoid shape, extending along the X-axis (past-future) and Y-axis (duration).\n\n*   **\"Present\" Cluster:** Today, Yesterday, Tomorrow - tightly grouped around the origin, forming a very small cluster.\n*   **\"Past Personal\" Cluster:** Childhood, Nostalgia - grouped in the negative X quadrant with positive Z values.  These are relatively close together, suggesting a connection between memories and personal experience.\n*   **\"Future Oriented\" Cluster:** Future and Deadline -  Both are in the positive X quadrant, but Deadline is further along the negative Z axis, indicating a stronger linear, abstract quality.\n*   **\"Scale Markers\":** Moment and Century – lie on the Y-axis with small X-values. Eternity lies furthest up along the Y axis.\n*    **Old Age:** A somewhat isolated point, in the far past and somewhat towards the positive Z, perhaps due to being both a lived experience *and* a significant duration.\n\n**5. Intuitive Feel of Stability, Tensions, Resonance:**\n\n*   **Stability:** The \"present\" cluster (Today, Yesterday, Tomorrow) is remarkably stable, as expected.\n*   **Tensions:** There's a tension between the \"Past Personal\" (childhood, nostalgia) and the more abstract linear time represented by \"Deadline.\"  They're both in the past-oriented direction, but have very different Z-axis values.\n*   **Resonance:** Childhood and Nostalgia have a strong resonance with each other, suggesting they're closely related concepts in the embedding space.   Old age resonates with the past, but has an additional element of duration and lived experience.  Hour and Century serve as anchor points for understanding shorter and longer temporal spans. Eternity is somewhat detached, representing a concept beyond direct human experience.","model":"gemma3:27b-it-qat","modelName":"gemma3:27b-it-qat","modelIdx":0,"timestamp":1767757076,"lastSentence":"Hour and Century serve as anchor points for understanding shorter and longer temporal spans.","usage":{"response_token/s":40.41,"prompt_token/s":877.37,"total_duration":30237909734,"load_duration":100074371,"prompt_eval_count":195,"prompt_tokens":195,"prompt_eval_duration":222254327,"eval_count":1187,"completion_tokens":1187,"eval_duration":29374482797,"approximate_total":"0h0m30s","total_tokens":1382,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}},"done":true,"followUps":["Could you explain the reasoning behind the specific Z-axis coordinate values for concepts like 'Childhood' and 'Deadline' in more detail?","If you were to add a concept like 'regret' to this model, where would it likely be positioned and why?","What might the overall shape of this ellipsoid tell us about how the model 'understands' the relationship between time and human experience?","How sensitive is this model to the ordering or phrasing of the input concepts?
