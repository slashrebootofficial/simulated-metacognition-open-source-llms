Emergent clusters & overall shape**\n\n| Cluster (approx.) | Members (core) | Why they cluster |\n|-------------------|----------------|------------------|\n| **Pure‑visual / natural** | mirage, camouflage | Both are visual tricks with little to no human intent; sit far left (X ≈ ‑0.8) and low Y. |\n| **Performance‑visual** | magic trick, deepfake | High X‑positive (visual) **and** high Y (deliberate performance); share a “spectacle” vibe. |\n| **Verbal‑informational** | lie, fake news, catfish | X‑positive, moderate‑high Y, Z near zero (targeted at individuals or small groups). |\n| **Strategic‑interpersonal** | gaslighting, poker bluff, Trojan horse | Highest Y values (0.8‑0.9), Z negative (personal or covert) – “weaponised” social tactics. |\n| **Self‑oriented** | placebo, self‑deception | Strong negative Z, low‑positive Y (placebo) or negative Y (self‑deception) – internal feedback loops. |\n\n*Geometrically the points roughly form a **distorted tetrahedron** with the anchor at its centre:*\n\n* the **base** (X‑negative side) is the visual‑natural triangle (mirage–camouflage–placebo).  \n* the **front face** (X‑positive side) is the verbal‑informational triangle (lie–fake news–catfish).  \n* the **top vertex** (high Y) is the strategic‑interpersonal peak (gaslighting, poker bluff, Trojan horse).  \n* the **bottom vertex** (negative Z) is the self‑oriented pit (placebo, self‑deception).\n\nConnecting the points gives a **skewed pyramid** whose edges are not equal – the longest edge runs between mirage (pure visual) and gaslighting (high‑strategic verbal), reflecting the greatest semantic gulf.\n\n---\n\n**4.  Intuitive “feel” of the space**\n\n* **Stability vs. tension** – Points that sit near the centre (lie, fake news, catfish) feel “balanced”: they are everyday, socially recognisable deceptions that blend visual and verbal cues with moderate intent. They are the most “stable” in the sense that small shifts in context (e.g., tone, medium) keep them within the same neighbourhood.\n\n* **Tension lines** – The line from **mirage** to **gaslighting** stretches across the full spectrum of modality (visual → verbal) and intent (incidental → highly manipulative). It feels like a tension spring: a tiny change in perception can swing a natural illusion into a weaponised psychological attack.\n\n* **Resonance** – The **strategic‑interpersonal** cluster (gaslighting, poker bluff, Trojan horse) resonates together because they share high Y and negative Z: they are “weaponised” toward another mind or system. Moving a point within this cluster (e.g., making a poker bluff more public) pulls it toward the **informational** face, hinting at the fluid boundary between game‑play and propaganda.\n\n* **Self‑oriented basin** – The negative‑Z basin (placebo, self‑deception) feels like a “gravity well”: once a deception turns inward, the pull toward external, visible forms weakens. The basin is shallow (distances ~0.86‑0.90) meaning it is easy for an internal illusion to be externalised (e.g., a placebo narrative becoming a marketed “miracle cure”).\n\n* **Overall ambience** – Standing at the origin, you sense a **balanced hub** where deception can radiate outward along three independent “directions” (how you show it, how much you plan it, who you aim it at). The space is not a perfect sphere; it is elongated toward high‑strategic interpersonal tactics, and compressed toward natural visual tricks, reflecting the reality that human‑crafted deception occupies a larger, more complex semantic volume than accidental perceptual illusions.\n\n---\n\n### Quick reference summary\n\n| Axis | Negative extreme | Positive extreme |\n|------|------------------|------------------|\n| **X (Modality)** | pure visual (mirage, camouflage) | pure verbal (lie, fake news) |\n| **Y (Strategic intent)** | incidental/natural (mirage, placebo) | highly calculated (gaslighting, Trojan horse) |\n| **Z (Scope)** | self‑oriented/internal (placebo, self‑deception) | systemic/public (deepfake, fake news) |\n\nThe coordinates above are a **conceptual projection** of the internal embedding relationships into a human‑readable 3‑D map.
