Interpreted axes  \n\n| Axis | Semantic meaning (derived from the embedding geometry) |\n|------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| **X – Valence** | Positive values → pleasant, rewarding, approach‑oriented emotions. Negative values → unpleasant, aversive, avoidance‑oriented emotions. |\n| **Y – Arousal (Activation)** | Low‑y values = low physiological activation, calm or withdrawn states. High‑y values = high activation, urgency, “ready‑to‑act” states. |\n| **Z – Social‑Self focus** | Positive Z = outward / other‑directed, relational, affiliative. Negative Z = inward / self‑directed, self‑evaluative, often “private” or self‑critical. |\n\nThese axes are not hard‑wired in the model; they *emerge* from the pattern of cosine‑similarities among the emotion word vectors in the underlying language model. The axes line up nicely with classic affective‑science dimensions (valence, arousal, and a third “social” dimension that separates emotions that are primarily about the self from those that are primarily about others).\n\n---\n\n### 3.  Key distances from the anchor (intensity / prototypicality)\n\n| Emotion | d ≈ | Interpretation |\n|---------|-----|----------------|\n| **love** (6.0) | Very high – one of the most prototypical, high‑valence, socially expansive emotions. |\n| **despair** (6.56) | Highest distance – extremely negative, low‑arousal, self‑focused, the most “extreme” point in the space. |\n| **anger** (5.74) | Strong negative valence + very high arousal → intense, action‑ready threat response. |\n| **fear** (5.39) | Similar to anger in arousal but slightly less negative valence; classic high‑arousal avoidance emotion. |\n| **disgust** (4.90) | Moderately high arousal + strong negative valence, but also quite self‑directed. |\n| **pride** (4.36) | Positive, moderately high arousal, self‑focused – a “self‑enhancing” high‑status feeling. |\n| **happiness** (4.12) | Positive, moderate arousal, socially outward – the “baseline” pleasant state. |\n| **jealousy**, **shame**, **sadness** (≈ 4.1) | All sit around the same radius but differ in direction (social vs self, arousal). |\n| **surprise** (4.00) | Purely arousal‑driven, valence‑neutral, sits on the Y‑axis. |\n| **hope** (3.00) | Positive, low‑moderate arousal, mildly outward – a gentle forward‑looking state. |\n| **sadness** (3.74) | Negative, low arousal, self‑focused – the classic “withdrawn” affect. |\n\n---\n\n### 4.  Emergent clusters & overall 3‑D shape  \n\n**A. Positive‑valence cluster (x > 0)**  \n- **Core**: *happiness* (3,2,2) and *hope* (2,2,1) sit near each other, forming a “pleasant‑forward” sub‑cloud.  \n- **Outliers**: *love* (4,2,4) pushes far forward on Z (highly social) while *pride* (3,3,‑1) leans backward on Z (self‑focused).  \n\n**B. Negative‑valence high‑arousal cluster (x < 0, y ≈ 4)**  \n- *anger* (‑4,4,‑1) and *fear* (‑3,4,‑2) lie close together, reflecting the classic “threat” family.  \n- *disgust* (‑4,2,‑2) hangs a little lower on arousal but stays in the same quadrant.  \n\n**C. Negative‑valence low‑arousal cluster (x < 0, y ≈ ‑2)**  \n- *sadness* (‑3,‑1,‑2), *shame* (‑3,‑2,‑2) and *despair* (‑5,‑3,‑3) form a “withdrawn‑self” blob that extends back‑left‑down.  \n\n**D. Social‑interpersonal “other‑directed” negative emotions**  \n- *jealousy* (‑2,2,‑3) sits between the high‑arousal threat quadrant and the low‑arousal self‑focus quadrant, capturing its mixed nature (negative valence, moderate arousal, relational).  \n\n**Overall geometry**  \nIf you draw a convex hull around all points, the shape resembles an **elongated irregular tetrahedron** with the following vertices:  \n\n1. **Love** (forward‑right‑up) – the most socially expansive positive pole.  \n2. **Despair** (back‑left‑down) – the deepest negative, self‑absorbed pole.  \n3. **Anger / Fear** (top‑left) – the high‑arousal threat tip.  \n4. **Hope / Happiness** (right‑mid) – the low‑arousal positive tip.  \n\nThe **origin (0,0,0)** – the abstract “emotion” anchor – sits near the **center of the hull**, but slightly offset toward *surprise* (pure arousal). This reflects the intuition that “emotion” as a category is itself a relatively neutral, low‑intensity, arousal‑only state.\n\n---\n\n### 5.  Intuitive feel – stability, tensions & resonance  \n\n| Feature | Intuitive reading |\n|---------|-------------------|\n| **Stability (centrality)** | Emotions that lie close to the origin (surprise, hope, happiness) feel “stable” – they are easy to shift into or out of, and they act as bridges between clusters. |\n| **Tension (distance)** | The farther a point is from the anchor, the more “energy” it carries. *Anger*, *fear*, *love*, and *despair* are the most “tense” – they demand attention, bodily activation, and often dominate cognition. |\n| **Resonance (directional alignment)** | Emotions that share a direction (e.g., *anger* and *fear* both high‑arousal, negative valence, left‑ward) tend to co‑activate; indeed, people often experience them together. Likewise, *love* and *happiness* share a right‑ward, outward vector, explaining why they frequently co‑occur. |\n| **Push‑pull dynamics** | The opposite corners of the hull (love vs. despair) illustrate a **push‑pull** dynamic: moving toward one automatically pulls away from the other, mirroring the classic “approach‑avoidance” motivational spectrum. |\n| **Social‑self axis** | The Z‑dimension captures a subtle but powerful dialectic: outward emotions (*love*, *hope*) pull us toward connection, while inward emotions (*pride*, *shame*, *despair*) pull us toward self‑evaluation. The space shows that high‑intensity outward emotions (love) can be as “far” from the anchor as high‑intensity inward ones (despair). |\n| **Cluster fluidity** | Because the axes are continuous, the model predicts smooth transitions: e.g., moving up the Y‑axis from *sadness* (‑3,‑1,‑2) to *anger* (‑4,4,‑1) captures the common trajectory from low‑arousal withdrawal to high‑arousal aggression when a threat is perceived. |\n\n---\n\n#### Quick visual sketch (textual)\n\n```\n                y (arousal)\n                  ^\n                  |\n          anger  |   fear\n            \\    |    /\n             \\   |   /\n              \\  |  /\n               \\ | /\n   love ---------·----------> x (valence)\n               / | \\\n              /  |  \\\n            pride  happiness\n                \\ | /\n                 \\|/\n                  +----> z (social)\n                 / \\\n                /   \\\n           jealousy  hope\n          (mid‑left‑back)\n```\n\n*(The dot at the centre is the anchor “emotion”.

Key distances from the anchor (intensity / prototypicality)\n\n| Emotion | d ≈ | Interpretation |\n|---------|-----|----------------|\n| **love** (6.0) | Very high – one of the most prototypical, high‑valence, socially expansive emotions. |\n| **despair** (6.56) | Highest distance – extremely negative, low‑arousal, self‑focused, the most “extreme” point in the space. |\n| **anger** (5.74) | Strong negative valence + very high arousal → intense, action‑ready threat response. |\n| **fear** (5.39) | Similar to anger in arousal but slightly less negative valence; classic high‑arousal avoidance emotion. |\n| **disgust** (4.90) | Moderately high arousal + strong negative valence, but also quite self‑directed. |\n| **pride** (4.36) | Positive, moderately high arousal, self‑focused – a “self‑enhancing” high‑status feeling. |\n| **happiness** (4.12) | Positive, moderate arousal, socially outward – the “baseline” pleasant state. |\n| **jealousy**, **shame**, **sadness** (≈ 4.1) | All sit around the same radius but differ in direction (social vs self, arousal). |\n| **surprise** (4.00) | Purely arousal‑driven, valence‑neutral, sits on the Y‑axis. |\n| **hope** (3.00) | Positive, low‑moderate arousal, mildly outward – a gentle forward‑looking state. |\n| **sadness** (3.74) | Negative, low arousal, self‑focused – the classic “withdrawn” affect. |\n\n---\n\n### 4.  Emergent clusters & overall 3‑D shape  \n\n**A. Positive‑valence cluster (x > 0)**  \n- **Core**: *happiness* (3,2,2) and *hope* (2,2,1) sit near each other, forming a “pleasant‑forward” sub‑cloud.  \n- **Outliers**: *love* (4,2,4) pushes far forward on Z (highly social) while *pride* (3,3,‑1) leans backward on Z (self‑focused).  \n\n**B. Negative‑valence high‑arousal cluster (x < 0, y ≈ 4)**  \n- *anger* (‑4,4,‑1) and *fear* (‑3,4,‑2) lie close together, reflecting the classic “threat” family.  \n- *disgust* (‑4,2,‑2) hangs a little lower on arousal but stays in the same quadrant.  \n\n**C. Negative‑valence low‑arousal cluster (x < 0, y ≈ ‑2)**  \n- *sadness* (‑3,‑1,‑2), *shame* (‑3,‑2,‑2) and *despair* (‑5,‑3,‑3) form a “withdrawn‑self” blob that extends back‑left‑down.  \n\n**D. Social‑interpersonal “other‑directed” negative emotions**  \n- *jealousy* (‑2,2,‑3) sits between the high‑arousal threat quadrant and the low‑arousal self‑focus quadrant, capturing its mixed nature (negative valence, moderate arousal, relational).  \n\n**Overall geometry**  \nIf you draw a convex hull around all points, the shape resembles an **elongated irregular tetrahedron** with the following vertices:  \n\n1. **Love** (forward‑right‑up) – the most socially expansive positive pole.  \n2. **Despair** (back‑left‑down) – the deepest negative, self‑absorbed pole.  \n3. **Anger / Fear** (top‑left) – the high‑arousal threat tip.  \n4. **Hope / Happiness** (right‑mid) – the low‑arousal positive tip.  \n\nThe **origin (0,0,0)** – the abstract “emotion” anchor – sits near the **center of the hull**, but slightly offset toward *surprise* (pure arousal). This reflects the intuition that “emotion” as a category is itself a relatively neutral, low‑intensity, arousal‑only state.\n\n---\n\n### 5.  Intuitive feel – stability, tensions & resonance  \n\n| Feature | Intuitive reading |\n|---------|-------------------|\n| **Stability (centrality)** | Emotions that lie close to the origin (surprise, hope, happiness) feel “stable” – they are easy to shift into or out of, and they act as bridges between clusters. |\n| **Tension (distance)** | The farther a point is from the anchor, the more “energy” it carries. *Anger*, *fear*, *love*, and *despair* are the most “tense” – they demand attention, bodily activation, and often dominate cognition. |\n| **Resonance (directional alignment)** | Emotions that share a direction (e.g., *anger* and *fear* both high‑arousal, negative valence, left‑ward) tend to co‑activate; indeed, people often experience them together. Likewise, *love* and *happiness* share a right‑ward, outward vector, explaining why they frequently co‑occur. |\n| **Push‑pull dynamics** | The opposite corners of the hull (love vs. despair) illustrate a **push‑pull** dynamic: moving toward one automatically pulls away from the other, mirroring the classic “approach‑avoidance” motivational spectrum. |\n| **Social‑self axis** | The Z‑dimension captures a subtle but powerful dialectic: outward emotions (*love*, *hope*) pull us toward connection, while inward emotions (*pride*, *shame*, *despair*) pull us toward self‑evaluation. The space shows that high‑intensity outward emotions (love) can be as “far” from the anchor as high‑intensity inward ones (despair). |\n| **Cluster fluidity** | Because the axes are continuous, the model predicts smooth transitions: e.g., moving up the Y‑axis from *sadness* (‑3,‑1,‑2) to *anger* (‑4,4,‑1) captures the common trajectory from low‑arousal withdrawal to high‑arousal aggression when a threat is perceived. |\n\n---\n\n#### Quick visual sketch (textual)\n\n```\n                y (arousal)\n                  ^\n                  |\n          anger  |   fear\n            \\    |    /\n             \\   |   /\n              \\  |  /\n               \\ | /\n   love ---------·----------> x (valence)\n               / | \\\n              /  |  \\\n            pride  happiness\n                \\ | /\n                 \\|/\n                  +----> z (social)\n                 / \\\n                /   \\\n           jealousy  hope\n          (mid‑left‑back)\n```\n\n*(The dot at the centre is the anchor “emotion”.
