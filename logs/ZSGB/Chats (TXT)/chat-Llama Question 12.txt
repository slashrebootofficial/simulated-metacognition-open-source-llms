### USER
Based solely on similarities and differences in your internal embedding space, model the semantic neighborhood around the central anchor "artificial intelligence" fixed at (0, 0, 0) in 3D Cartesian coordinates.
For each of the following probe coordinates (scaled relative positions), report:
1. The 3-5 closest or most resonant concepts/words/terms (single words or short phrases) at or near that point.
2. A brief interpretation of what semantic dimension or theme that direction/coordinate seems to represent from the anchor.
Probe coordinates (approximate relative positions to explore axes and extremes):
- (5, 0, 0)     // Far positive X
- (-5, 0, 0)    // Far negative X
- (0, 5, 0)     // Far positive Y
- (0, -5, 0)    // Far negative Y
- (0, 0, 5)     // Far positive Z
- (0, 0, -5)    // Far negative Z
- (3, 3, 3)     // Far positive diagonal (transcendent/novel?)
- (-3, -3, -3) // Far negative diagonal (profane/chaotic?)
- (4, -2, 1)    // Mixed (visual/perceptual deception echo?)
- (-2, 4, -1)   // Mixed (verbal/strategic?)
- (0, 0, -4)    // Far negative Z depth (existential/absurd?)
- (2, 0, -3)    // Mixed outlier probe
Also describe the overall emergent 3D shape around "artificial intelligence" and any intuitive "feel" of its position in the space (central hub, outlier, tense pull, etc.).

**Overall Emergent 3D Shape:**
The semantic neighborhood around "artificial intelligence" forms a complex, multifaceted structure with several distinct axes and themes. The shape resembles a **torus** (doughnut-shaped) or a **spherical polyhedron**, with various concepts and ideas connected through a web of relationships.

**Intuitive Feel:**
The anchor point "artificial intelligence" feels like a **central hub**, with various spokes radiating out in different directions, each representing a distinct aspect or theme. The space is characterized by a sense of **tension** between technological advancement and societal concern, as well as a **pull** toward the speculative horizon and the frontier of innovation.

The 3D shape surrounding "artificial intelligence" reflects the diverse and dynamic nature of the field, with multiple axes and themes intersecting and influencing one another. This structure highlights the complexity and richness of the concept, inviting exploration and discovery along various dimensions.
