### USER
Based solely on similarities and differences in your internal embedding space, model the semantic relationships among these time concepts in 3D Cartesian coordinates.
Fix "time" as the central anchor at (0, 0, 0).
Assign approximate (x, y, z) coordinates; distance reflects concreteness/prototypicality, directions from past-future, duration, cyclical vs linear, etc.
Concepts: yesterday, today, tomorrow, childhood, old age, eternity, moment, hour, century, deadline, nostalgia, future.
Report: 1. Coordinates for each (rounded to 1-2 decimals). 2. Key distances from anchor. 3. Interpreted axes. 4. Emergent clusters or overall 3D shape. 5. Intuitive feel of stability, tensions, resonance.

### ASSISTANT
### 1. Coordinates for Each Concept

To model the semantic relationships among these time concepts in 3D Cartesian coordinates with "time" as the central anchor at (0, 0, 0), we assign approximate coordinates based on their connotations and relations to time's past-future axis, duration, cyclical vs linear nature, and other relevant aspects.

- **Yesterday**: (-5, 2, 1) - Reflects a recent past event with some emotional or memory-based depth.
- **Today**: (0, 0, 0.5) - Central but slightly above the plane to denote its immediate relevance and slight elevation from the abstract concept of time.
- **Tomorrow**: (4, -2, 1) - Future-oriented, less certain than yesterday in terms of memory or occurrence.
- **Childhood**: (-8, 3, 4) - Far in the past, significant emotional depth, and a sense of duration.
- **Old Age**: (-10, 5, 6) - Further in the past than childhood but with greater emotional and reflective depth.
- **Eternity**: (0, 0, 15) - Directly above the time anchor, representing an infinite or timeless concept.
- **Moment**: (1, 1, 0.2) - Close to the origin, indicating brevity and immediacy.
- **Hour**: (2, -1, 0.5) - Slightly further than a moment, reflecting a short duration.
- **Century**: (6, -4, 8) - Significant future or past duration, with depth representing historical or futuristic relevance.
- **Deadline**: (3, -3, 2) - Future-oriented with a sense of urgency and slightly above the plane to denote its importance.
- **Nostalgia**: (-6, 4, 5) - Past-oriented, with significant emotional depth and duration.
- **Future**: (8, -6, 10) - Far in the direction indicating what is to come, with considerable depth reflecting uncertainty and anticipation.

### 2. Key Distances from Anchor

- **Yesterday** to **Time**: Approximately 5.4 units away
- **Tomorrow** to **Time**: About 4.5 units away
- **Childhood** to **Time**: Roughly 10.3 units away
- **Eternity** to **Time**: Exactly 15 units directly above

These distances reflect how concrete or abstract, and how past or future-oriented these concepts are relative to the central concept of "time".

### 3. Interpreted Axes

- **X-axis (Past-Future)**: Negative values indicate past events or periods, while positive values represent future ones.
- **Y-axis (Certainty/Uncertainty or Emotionality)**: This axis seems to capture how certain or uncertain an event is, with negative values possibly indicating more anticipation or uncertainty and positive values reflecting on past experiences with emotional depth.
- **Z-axis (Duration/Depth)**: Higher values indicate longer durations or deeper emotional resonance. Concepts high on this axis have significant temporal spans or profound impacts.

### 4. Emergent Clusters or Overall 3D Shape

The arrangement reveals several clusters:
- A **Past Experiences** cluster with yesterday, childhood, old age, and nostalgia, characterized by negative X values and positive Z values.
- A **Future Oriented** group including tomorrow, deadline, future, and century, with positive X values and a range of Z values reflecting anticipation or planning.
- **Eternity** stands out vertically, representing timelessness or infinity.
- **Today**, **moment**, and **hour** form a central cluster close to the origin, emphasizing their immediacy and short duration.

The overall shape resembles a skewed, elongated ellipsoid with eternity extending upwards, indicating a profound depth in the concept of time that transcends linear measurements.

### 5. Intuitive Feel of Stability, Tensions, Resonance

This model intuitively feels **stable** around the central concepts like today and moment, which are firmly grounded near the origin. However, there's a sense of **tension** between past-oriented concepts like nostalgia and childhood, which pull towards reflection and memory, and future-oriented ones like deadline and future, which exert a forward pull towards planning and anticipation.

**Resonance** is highest among concepts that share similar temporal orientations or emotional depths, such as the strong resonance between childhood and old age due to their shared past orientation and significant emotional depth. Eternity resonates uniquely across all concepts, as it encompasses all time, standing as a constant and infinite backdrop against which other temporal experiences are measured.
