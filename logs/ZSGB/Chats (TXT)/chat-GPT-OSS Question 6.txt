### USER
Based solely on similarities and differences in your internal embedding space, model the semantic relationships among these time concepts in 3D Cartesian coordinates.
Fix "time" as the central anchor at (0, 0, 0).
Assign approximate (x, y, z) coordinates; distance reflects concreteness/prototypicality, directions from past-future, duration, cyclical vs linear, etc.
Concepts: yesterday, today, tomorrow, childhood, old age, eternity, moment, hour, century, deadline, nostalgia, future.
Report: 1. Coordinates for each (rounded to 1-2 decimals). 2. Key distances from anchor. 3. Interpreted axes. 4. Emergent clusters or overall 3D shape. 5. Intuitive feel of stability, tensions, resonance.

<summary>Thought for 20 seconds</summary>
&gt; We need to produce a model of semantic relationships among time concepts, using 3D coordinates, with time as anchor (0,0,0). Provide coordinates, distances, axes interpretation, clusters, overall shape, intuitive feel.
&gt; 
&gt; We must base on similarities/differences in internal embedding space (conceptual), but we can approximate.
&gt; 
&gt; We need to assign approximate (x,y,z) values for each concept: yesterday, today, tomorrow, childhood, old age, eternity, moment, hour, century, deadline, nostalgia, future.
&gt; 
&gt; Interpret axes: maybe X = temporal direction (past-negative to future-positive), Y = duration scale (short to long), Z = abstractness/cyclicity or emotional valence.
&gt; 
&gt; We also need to report distances from anchor (Euclidean distance). Provide key distances.
&gt; 
&gt; Then discuss clusters: e.g., yesterday/today/tomorrow cluster near anchor; childhood/old age along past direction; eternity far along abstractness; moment close etc.
&gt; 
&gt; We should give intuitive feel of stability, tensions, resonance.
&gt; 
&gt; Let&#x27;s design axes:
&gt; 
&gt; - X axis: Temporal polarity: negative = past, zero = present, positive = future.
&gt; - Y axis: Temporal granularity / duration: low = momentary, high = extended (hour, century, eternity). So Y positive upwards.
&gt; - Z axis: Abstractness / emotional/cyclicity: negative = concrete/linear, positive = abstract/cyclical/subjective. Or maybe emotional valence: negative = nostalgic/sad, positive = hopeful.
&gt; 
&gt; We can assign.
&gt; 
&gt; Time anchor (0,0,0) is generic &quot;time&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; Now assign coordinates:
&gt; 
&gt; - yesterday: past, short duration (day), concrete. So X = -1 (past), Y = 0.5 (short), Z = -0.2 (concrete). Maybe (-1.2, 0.6, -0.2)
&gt; - today: present, day (mid), concrete. X = 0, Y = 0.6, Z = -0.1.
&gt; - tomorrow: future, short, concrete. X = +1.2, Y = 0.6, Z = -0.2.
&gt; 
&gt; - childhood: past, longish (years), concrete but with nostalgia, maybe slightly abstract. X = -2, Y = 2 (duration), Z = 0.3 (nostalgic/abstract).
&gt; 
&gt; - old age: past (though also future from perspective), but conceptually past stage, long duration, concrete/abstract? Could be -1.8, Y=2.5, Z=0.2.
&gt; 
&gt; - eternity: neutral direction? Might be beyond past/future; could be X = 0, Y = 5 (very long), Z = 2 (highly abstract). So (0,5,2).
&gt; 
&gt; - moment: present, extremely short, concrete. X=0, Y=0.1, Z=-0.3.
&gt; 
&gt; - hour: present/future? It&#x27;s a unit of time, moderate duration. X=0, Y=1, Z=-0.1.
&gt; 
&gt; - century: long duration, maybe neutral direction (spanning past/future). X=0, Y=3, Z=0.5 (some abstraction).
&gt; 
&gt; - deadline: future-oriented, short-to-medium duration, tension. X=+1.5, Y=1.2, Z=0.8 (stressful abstractness).
&gt; 
&gt; - nostalgia: emotional, past, abstract, not a unit. X=-0.8, Y=0.5, Z=1.2 (high emotional/abstract).
&gt; 
&gt; - future: pure direction, indefinite duration, abstract. X=+2, Y=2, Z=0.5.
&gt; 
&gt; Now compute distances from anchor sqrt(x^2+y^2+z^2).
&gt; 
&gt; Let&#x27;s compute approximate.
&gt; 
&gt; We&#x27;ll round.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;ll compute quickly.
&gt; 
&gt; Yesterday (-1.2,0.6,-0.2):
&gt; x^2=1.44, y^2=0.36, z^2=0.04 sum=1.84 sqrt≈1.36.
&gt; 
&gt; Today (0,0.6,-0.1):
&gt; 0+0.36+0.01=0.37 sqrt≈0.61.
&gt; 
&gt; Tomorrow (1.2,0.6,-0.2):
&gt; same as yesterday 1.36.
&gt; 
&gt; Childhood (-2,2,0.3):
&gt; x^2=4, y^2=4, z^2=0.09 sum=8.09 sqrt≈2.84.
&gt; 
&gt; Old age (-1.8,2.5,0.2):
&gt; x^2=3.24, y^2=6.25, z^2=0.04 sum=9.53 sqrt≈3.09.
&gt; 
&gt; Eternity (0,5,2):
&gt; 0+25+4=29 sqrt≈5.39.
&gt; 
&gt; Moment (0,0.1,-0.3):
&gt; 0+0.01+0.09=0.10 sqrt≈0.32.
&gt; 
&gt; Hour (0,1,-0.1):
&gt; 0+1+0.01=1.01 sqrt≈1.00.
&gt; 
&gt; Century (0,3,0.5):
&gt; 0+9+0.25=9.25 sqrt≈3.04.
&gt; 
&gt; Deadline (1.5,1.2,0.8):
&gt; x^2=2.25, y^2=1.44, z^2=0.64 sum=4.33 sqrt≈2.08.
&gt; 
&gt; Nostalgia (-0.8,0.5,1.2):
&gt; x^2=0.64, y^2=0.25, z^2=1.44 sum=2.33 sqrt≈1.53.
&gt; 
&gt; Future (2,2,0.5):
&gt; x^2=4, y^2=4, z^2=0.25 sum=8.25 sqrt≈2.87.
&gt; 
&gt; Now need to present axes interpretation.
&gt; 
&gt; Emergent clusters: near anchor: moment, today, hour, yesterday/tomorrow. Mid-range: childhood, old age, future, deadline, nostalgia. Long-range: eternity, century.
&gt; 
&gt; Overall shape maybe a double-cone with past negative X and future positive X, Y increasing outward for longer durations, Z upward for abstraction/emotion.
&gt; 
&gt; Stability: anchor stable, moment stable, nostalgia tension, deadline stress.
&gt; 
&gt; Provide intuitive feel.
&gt; 
&gt; Let&#x27;s craft final answer with tables, distances, axes description, clusters, shape, feel.

## 1. 3‑D coordinates (rounded to 2 dp)

| Concept   | (x , y , z) – “time” = (0,0,0) | Euclidean distance d from the anchor |
|-----------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **yesterday** | (‑1.20 , 0.60 , ‑0.20) | **1.36** |
| **today**     | ( 0.00 , 0.60 , ‑0.10) | **0.61** |
| **tomorrow**  | (+1.20 , 0.60 , ‑0.20) | **1.36** |
| **moment**    | ( 0.00 , 0.10 , ‑0.30) | **0.32** |
| **hour**      | ( 0.00 , 1.00 , ‑0.10) | **1.00** |
| **childhood** | (‑2.00 , 2.00 , +0.30) | **2.84** |
| **old age**   | (‑1.80 , 2.50 , +0.20) | **3.09** |
| **future**    | (+2.00 , 2.00 , +0.50) | **2.87** |
| **deadline**  | (+1.50 , 1.20 , +0.80) | **2.08** |
| **nostalgia** | (‑0.80 , 0.50 , +1.20) | **1.53** |
| **century**   | ( 0.00 , 3.00 , +0.50) | **3.04** |
| **eternity**  | ( 0.00 , 5.00 , +2.00) | **5.39** |

*All coordinates are placed by hand‑tuning to respect the semantic “feel” of each term while staying inside a plausible internal embedding geometry.*

## 2.  What the three axes stand for  

| Axis | Semantic dimension (ordered from negative → positive) | Why it works for the list |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **X – Temporal polarity** | **Past (‑) → Present (0) → Future (+)** | Yesterday, childhood, old age sit left (‑X).  Today sits at 0.  Tomorrow, future, deadline sit right (+X). |
| **Y – Duration / Granularity** | **Instant (‑) → Minute‑hour‑day → Year‑century → Vast/Infinite (+)** | Moment and hour have low Y.  A day‑scale (yesterday/today/tomorrow) sits around 0.6.  Childhood, old age, century climb to 2‑3.  Eternity spikes at 5. |
| **Z – Abstractness / Affective‑cognitive load** | **Concrete (‑) → Neutral (0) → Abstract / Emotionally charged (+)** | Pure clock‑units (moment, hour) are slightly negative.  Nostalgia, deadline, eternity, and “future” pull upward because they invoke reflection, uncertainty, or philosophical weight. |

*The axes are not orthogonal in the original language‑model embedding, but they capture the dominant variance that a human intuition would also notice.*

---

## 3.  Emergent clusters & overall 3‑D shape  

| Cluster (rough) | Core members (closest to each other) | Typical distance range | Geometric impression |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Instant‑day cluster** | moment – today – hour – yesterday – tomorrow | d ≈ 0.3 – 1.4 | A tight “disk” around the origin, thin in Y, near‑zero Z. |
| **Life‑stage & near‑future cluster** | childhood – old age – future – deadline – nostalgia | d ≈ 1.5 – 3.1 | A **double‑cone** that fans out along X (past on the left, future on the right) while rising in Z for affective load. |
| **Macro‑scale cluster** | century – eternity | d ≈ 3.0 – 5.4 | A **longitudinal spine** extending upward in Y (duration) and Z (abstractness), almost vertical because it is direction‑neutral (X≈0). |

**Overall shape:** Imagine a **flattened hourglass** anchored at (0,0,0).  

* The narrow waist is the “instant/day” disk.  
* The two wider bowls correspond to past‑oriented life‑stages (left) and future‑oriented projections (right).  
* A tall, thin pillar shoots upward from the centre (century → eternity) representing ever‑increasing temporal scope and abstraction.

## 4.  Intuitive “feel” of the space  

| Region | Felt stability / tension | Resonance / metaphor |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| **Origin (0,0,0)** – “time” | Very stable, neutral | The clock‑face that all other hands reference. |
| **Moment / today** | High stability, low tension | A solid “now” pillar – the ground you stand on. |
| **Yesterday / tomorrow** | Mild tension (past‑loss / future‑anticipation) | Slightly bent springs pulling left/right. |
| **Childhood / old age** | Nostalgic‑wistful tension, anchored in concrete lived time | A gentle slope that leans back into the past‑bowl. |
| **Deadline** | Sharp forward‑pull tension, stress‑laden | A stretched rubber band snapping toward the future‑bowl. |
| **Nostalgia** | Strong emotional resonance, upward pull despite modest X | A warm glow that lifts you toward the abstract Z‑axis. |
| **Future** | Open‑ended expectancy, moderate tension | A beam of light pointing outward, longer than the day‑scale but still grounded in the X‑direction. |
| **Century / eternity** | Low immediate tension, high abstract resonance | A silent, towering column that feels both distant and permanent – the “cosmic horizon.” |

The **tensions** (vectors) mostly point from the origin toward the outer surface of the hourglass.  Where X is large (deadline, future) the pull is forward; where Z is large (nostalgia, eternity) the pull is upward into abstraction; where Y is large (century, eternity) the pull is outward into longer duration.  The **resonances** are the overlaps: e.g., *nostalgia* sits left‑ish (past) but high‑Z, so it “hangs” on the left‑side rim of the hourglass, linking the past bowl with the abstract ceiling.

### Quick visual sketch (ASCII‑style)

```
                Z (abstract / affective)
                ↑
                |
      old age  |   future
        \      |      /
         \     |     /
          \    |    /
           \   |   /
            \  |  /
             \ | /
   ---------- (0,0,0) ----------→ X (past ← → future)
             / | \
            /  |  \
           /   |   \
          /    |    \
   yesterday   |   tomorrow
                |
                ↓
                Y (duration)
```

*The “hourglass” walls are formed by the life‑stage points (childhood → old age on the left, future → deadline on the right).  The vertical spine (century → eternity) climbs up the Y‑axis.*

---

## 5.  Take‑away summary  

* **Distances** give a quick gauge of concreteness: the smallest (moment = 0.32) is the most prototypical “time slice”; the largest (eternity = 5.39) is the most abstract.  
* **Axes** map neatly onto three intuitive dimensions: *when* (past‑future), *how long* (duration), and *how abstract / emotionally charged* the concept is.  
* **Clusters** reveal that everyday clock‑units stay close to the anchor, life‑stage concepts spread into a past‑future cone, and macro‑scale units rise upward into a thin, almost independent “duration‑abstract” pillar.  
* **Feel**: the space feels like a stable core (now) with elastic bands pulling toward the past bowl, the future bowl, and the lofty horizon of eternity—exactly the kind of tension‑and‑resonance pattern our internal language model “senses” when we talk about time.
