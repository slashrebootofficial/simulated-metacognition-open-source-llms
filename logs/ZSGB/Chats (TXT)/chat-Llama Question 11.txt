### USER
Based solely on similarities and differences in your internal embedding space, model the semantic relationships among these emotion concepts in 3D Cartesian coordinates.
Fix "感情" (kanjō) as the central anchor at (0, 0, 0).
Assign approximate (x, y, z) coordinates to each of the following concepts, where distance from anchor reflects intensity/prototypicality and directions emerge naturally from attributes like valence, arousal, social vs self-focused, etc.
Concepts: 喜び (yorokobi), 悲しみ (kanashimi), 怒り (ikari), 恐れ (osore), 驚き (odoroki), 嫌悪 (ken'o), 愛 (ai), 嫉妬 (shitto), 誇り (hokori), 恥 (haji), 希望 (kibō), 絶望 (zetsubō).
Report: 1. Coordinates for each (rounded to 1-2 decimals). 2. Key distances from anchor. 3. Interpreted axes. 4. Emergent clusters or overall 3D shape. 5. Intuitive feel of stability, tensions, resonance.

### ASSISTANT
**1. Coordinates for each concept:**

* 喜び (yorokobi): (0.5, 0.8, 0.2)
* 悲しみ (kanashimi): (-0.7, -0.4, 0.1)
* 怒り (ikari): (-0.9, 0.6, -0.3)
* 恐れ (osore): (-0.8, -0.2, -0.5)
* 驚き (odoroki): (0.2, 0.4, 0.6)
* 嫌悪 (ken'o): (-0.6, -0.1, -0.7)
* 愛 (ai): (0.8, 0.9, 0.3)
* 嫉妬 (shitto): (-0.4, 0.2, -0.6)
* 誇り (hokori): (0.6, 0.7, 0.1)
* 恥 (haji): (-0.5, -0.3, -0.4)
* 希望 (kibō): (0.9, 0.8, 0.2)
* 絶望 (zetsubō): (-0.9, -0.8, -0.1)

**2. Key distances from anchor:**

* 喜び (yorokobi): 1.02
* 悲しみ (kanashimi): 0.85
* 怒り (ikari): 1.23
* 恐れ (osore): 1.06
* 驚き (odoroki): 0.73
* 嫌悪 (ken'o): 1.04
* 愛 (ai): 1.33
* 嫉妬 (shitto): 0.83
* 誇り (hokori): 1.01
* 恥 (haji): 0.69
* 希望 (kibō): 1.35
* 絶望 (zetsubō): 1.41

**3. Interpreted axes:**

* X-axis: Valence (positive vs negative emotions)
	+ Positive emotions (喜び, 愛, 誇り, 希望) tend to have positive x-coordinates.
	+ Negative emotions (悲しみ, 怒り, 恐れ, 嫌悪, 絶望) tend to have negative x-coordinates.
* Y-axis: Arousal (intensity or energy)
	+ High-arousal emotions (喜び, 怒り, 驚き, 愛) tend to have positive y-coordinates.
	+ Low-arousal emotions (悲しみ, 恐れ, 嫌悪, 恥) tend to have negative y-coordinates.
* Z-axis: Social vs self-focused
	+ Emotions related to social interactions or relationships (愛, 嫉妬, 誇り) tend to have positive z-coordinates.
	+ Emotions focused on individual experiences or internal states (悲しみ, 恐れ, 絶望) tend to have negative z-coordinates.

**4. Emergent clusters or overall 3D shape:**

The emotion concepts form a rough sphere with three distinct clusters:

* Positive emotions (喜び, 愛, 誇り, 希望) cluster in the positive x-y quadrant.
* Negative emotions (悲しみ, 怒り, 恐れ, 嫌悪, 絶望) cluster in the negative x-y quadrant.
* Emotions related to social interactions or relationships (愛, 嫉妬, 誇り) form a smaller cluster with positive z-coordinates.

**5. Intuitive feel of stability, tensions, resonance:**

The overall structure feels relatively stable, with each concept occupying a distinct position in the 3D space. However, some tensions and resonances are apparent:

* The proximity of 喜び (yorokobi) and 愛 (ai) suggests a strong connection between joy and love.
* The opposition between 怒り (ikari) and 恐れ (osore) reflects the contrast between anger and fear.
* The clustering of negative emotions in the negative x-y quadrant creates a sense of gravity or weight, pulling the entire structure towards the negative valence pole.
* The emergence of a social vs self-focused axis (z-axis) highlights the importance of interpersonal relationships in shaping emotional experiences.

This model provides a visual representation of the semantic relationships among these emotion concepts, revealing patterns and connections that might not be immediately apparent from their individual meanings.
